    <h1 class="post-title">Reproducibility in the large-scale computation world</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Donoho’s two papers pointed out a very important question on the credibility of computational research, i.e. many of the computational results are non-reproducible. At the first glance this would be rather ridiculous because the spirit of science is its reproducibility. It would very difficult to persuade people by using results that are only observable in one laboratory but not others. However, it is quite common that computational results are not reproducible, which is mostly due to the attitudes and limitations of the researchers but not the nature of the research. A typical situation is that researchers in each group use their own code to analyze the data, and few groups would like to make the code publicly accessible.</p>

<p>As a pioneer in promoting the reproducible computation, J. Claerbout and his colleagues have developed a discipline for building their own software and publications. Later, Donoho and his colleagues released their codes for wavelet analysis, WaveLab, where all the code, datasets and details of the parameters to produce the figures in their publications were made available to anyone. This software received a lot of interest by the community, although the first intention was to make reproducible computational results, but it turned out to be also very beneficial to other researcher’s work greatly, therefore it becomes a benchmark of the research later.</p>

<p>There has been 15 years since WaveLab was released with the idea of reproducible computational research being promoted. It seems that more and more serious researchers and scientists have adopted this idea. The National Science Foundation (NSF) also requires data and other supporting materials for any research it funds to be made available to other researchers at no more than incremental cost. Meanwhile, more and more prestige journals have required the authors to provide more details or supplemental materials. Nevertheless, there is still some way to go before the whole science community adopt a common criteria on reproducibility of computational research.</p>

<p>There are still different opinions from other researchers, either due to the personal working styles or practical considerations. The price to pay for the reproducible research is more time to spend on the work, and it’s often less affordable for young scientists such as postdocs. There are sometimes one-off projects which are not worthy of investing a lot time. Also the data volume gets larger and large these days, making them impractical to maintain and share. However, on one hand, the reproducibility is always an important factor for more and more serious researchers, on the other hand, the mainstream journals or agencies such as NSF should enhance the force of reproducible computational research as a requirement.</p>
