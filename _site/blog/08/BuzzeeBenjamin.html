    <h3 id="reproducible-reserch">Reproducible Reserch</h3>

<p>In the 1995 paper by Donoho, I thought the following quote succinctly summarized
the key idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the
scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship
is the complete software development environment and the complete set
of instructions which generated the figures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote strikes at the very heart of science. Without reproducibility, the validity of 
scientific publications becomes an issue of faith. Humans are erroneous creatures, and 
a consensus is far more valuable than any one particular result.</p>

<p>I also found myself relating to Donoho’s lack of self trust:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Roughly speaking, he didn’t trust himself to do good work unless his results were
subject to open criticism by others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I currently work through a data analysis project, I can’t help but think an error might slip
through despite my best efforts. After spending a substantial amount of time staring and thinking
about the same code, I wonder if a set of fresh eyes and a different perspective would reveal
details or mistakes I had not noticed. In this sense I am skeptical of myself and would appreciate
any attempts to reproduce the same results. Particularly when an important scientific conclusion is on
the line, I don’t see how a result can be validated if the research is not reproducible.</p>

<p>These papers also hint at some topics we have seen before. Creating a project with reproducibility in mind
forces the authors to use ideas from literate programming that help with communication, collaboration and workflow. Additionally,
ethical issues like those we saw with Michael LaCour’s work can be avoided altogether if researchers are held to a reproducible standard. Hopefully as computational sciences mature reproducibility becomes a cornerstone of professional publications.</p>
