    <h1 class="post-title">Reproducibility in Computational Research</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The two papers address the problems of <em>reproduciblilty</em> in <em>Computational Research</em> and how the <em>definition</em> of reproducibilty has changed over last 15 years. When <code class="highlighter-rouge">WaveLab</code> was released 15 years ago, reproducibilty could be sufficiently met with details like options and parameters used. The software was intented to help other researchers and collaborators to reproduce results like plots by providing a standardized framework for wavelet analysis. According to the authors, credibilty of computaional research was strong and results were trusted by the scientific community.</p>

<p>Fifteen years later the authors revisit the requirements of reproducitbility in Computational Research. The massive advancements in computer software and hardware industry has created a variety of programming languages and hardware environments. This increased diversity has made computational research more <em>error-prone</em> and has created big credilbility problems amoung the scientific community. In this age, reproducibility can be better faciliated by making available the entire codes and software environments to researchers and other collaborators, and not just options and parameters.</p>

<p>One specific credibilty problem, I can think of, that is created by the availablity of vast number of programming languages, is the problem of code review. Fellow researchers and collaborators are generally proficient in different programming languages and a piece of software code written by one person cannot be reviewed or checked by others. This lack of peer review means that major result changing bugs, if any, may not be found and the faulty results can never be reproduced.</p>
