<h4 id="based-on-these-two-papers-write-a-blog-post-discussing-the-commonalities-and-changes-in-the-themes-and-solutions">Based on these two papers, write a blog post discussing the commonalities and changes in the themes and solutions.</h4>

<hr />

<p>While both papers discuss the importance of reproducible research, they seem to have very different tones and attempt to tackle separate issues. <em>Wavelab and Reproducible Research</em> appears to be more focused on the sharing of results while <em>15 Years of Reproducible Research</em> seems more focused on being able to test the validity of results.</p>

<p>In the 1995 paper, <em>Wavelab and Reproducible Research</em>, reproducible research is proposed as a better method of collaborating and as a way more effective way to communicate results. The paper discusses problems they are currently facing - reproducing graphs with the correct parameters, effectively communicating results as well as difficulties, and reducing sloppiness and self-delusion. It proposes reproducible research as a way to create results that are universal and transparent.</p>

<p>Written 15 years later, the second paper goes beyond proposing reproducible research as a way to strengthen any results, and proposes that reproducible research is absolutely necessary for the maturation of computational science. Current practices of scientific computation are described as immature and error-prone. While many results have been generated, <em>15 Years of Reproducible Research</em> claims that many of these results lack credibility.</p>

<p>The overall goal of both papers is the same. By promoting reproducible research, we can impose a discipline that will strengthen several facets of research, including the validity and communication of results.</p>
