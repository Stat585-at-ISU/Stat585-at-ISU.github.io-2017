    <h2 id="discuss-the-commonalities-and-changes-in-the-themes-and-solutions">Discuss the commonalities and changes in the themes and solutions</h2>

<p>These two papers focus on themes of convincing the importance of reproducibility for research, especially for computer science. These papers think knowing the importance of reproducibility ahead of time can help the researchers to better plan and conduct research by documentation.</p>

<p>The old paper “WaveLab and Reproducible Research” initializes the concerns for reproducibility since internet makes the share of software and information much easier. As Claerbout pointed out, “the research deliverable is not an image itself but instead the software environment that produces the image.” He mainly used documentation to overcome this issue, for example, he published CD_ROMS which contain the text books along with the interact document for the Wavelab. However, as the computational power get much stronger and the problem scales are much bigger, new issues raised. We even don’t know if we have done a good work unless the results were subject to open criticism by others. In other words, the importance of reproducibility is becoming more critical. The methods to solve this problem are also become much more complex. Simple documentation is not sufficient, directions（papers, algorithm, example, utilities）, documentation, dataset, boilerplate, user interface, effective communication and source code sharing are also needed. It’s like to ideas of “github” for group working.</p>

<p>One of the most important things I learned from these papers is that knowing the importance of reproducibility could give you motivation to do a better job, since you know someone else may reproduce your work and you do not make mistakes. It makes a lot of sense to me. As a TA, I always think I am more careful and focus when I write a solution for a homework than I do my own homework. Because I know the students may “reproduce” your solutions. What’s more, it will help you to get rid of the “lazy” methods in your research. For example, instead of writing couple of lines of code for a simple purpose, you will write a function to wrap things up and it is useful when you or other people want to “reproduce” this part of research. In sum, just like we statisticians say, “we are not only fit the data, we want to discover the mechanism behind that”, we should hold the belief that “the research deliverable is not a result itself but instead the procedure and software environment that produces the results.”</p>
