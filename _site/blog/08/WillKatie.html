  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In both the 1995 and 2008 papers, the overall theme of “reproducibility” is present. Reproducible research is something that was of concern in 1995, and still is today. However, over the years technology has drastically changed as well as human knowledge. In 1995, the main purpose of reproducibility was to reproduce the graphics and parameters that appeared in papers. The goal was to makes sure other people had access to the programs and code that they used in their research. By 2008, it was somewhat <em>easy</em> to reproduce the graphics and parameters with more advanced computational power. In 2008, the purpose of reproducibility shifted to catching the errors that the researchers made. It is inevitable that the potentiality of errors increases as computation in science advances. I’m sure that in the past errors were made as well, but now people are more aware of it and more keen to catch them.</p>
