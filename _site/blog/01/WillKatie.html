  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I remember an undergrad professor of mine looking back on the code she wrote for her dissertation and not being able to read it. I think it was then that I realized I should start documenting my code. Before coming to grad school, I just used some basic comments in my text to organize my thoughts. I found it hard to locate specific comments and chunks of code. I also had troubles writing what I wanted to within the code. With R Markdown, it is easy to decipher between comments and code. There is also much flexibility in writing with Latex in R Markdown. For these reasons, I find myself using literate programming almost on a daily basis. More specifically, I find R Markdown to be very useful in typing up homework assignments. Being the avid organizer that I am, I like that my code and my write-up are all in one document that looks nice. I also like how easy my projects are to read. I am never lost when I come back to a project I haven’t worked on in a while. I see myself continuing to use R Markdown (or some form of literate programming) throughout my academic and work career. I want to be able to look back on the work I did and make sense of it. I had to laugh when Knuth said that literate programming is addicting. I completely agree with him! It makes doing statistical projects so much easier, so why stop?</p>
