    <h1 class="post-title">Literate Programming</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This is the first time I have heard the term “Literate Programming”. The first thing I did after you mentioned this in the class is to search about Literate Programming on the internet. After reading about it on Wikipedia and some other blogs, I was excited to watch the video. The video is very informative and I learned a lot about literate programming.</p>

<p>As a programmer myself, I was trained to write necessary comments for functions and variables we use to write programs. I have to confess here; I do not like writing comments in the code I write. Last year I developed a web application, I left the documenting part until the end and I had no clue what was going on when I was looking at the code. It took me days to understand the code and comment it properly. After watching the video, my first thought was ‘I wish I watched this video a year ago’. This would have saved me time and the agony of understanding my own code.</p>

<p>As Dr. Knuth mentioned in the video, by diving large programs into smaller chunks with extensive commenting, we can easily track the errors and reduce the debugging time. People working in teams would benefit from incorporating literate programming in their projects and the code can be reproduced once it is written with proper documentation.</p>

<p>While it is difficult incorporating literal programming for a beginner, I can get used to it and probably would enjoy it. I appreciate the concept of literate programming and will definitely use it in my current and future projects.</p>
