    <h1 class="post-title">The Human Element of Coding</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’d never heard of <em>literate programming</em> prior to listening to Dr. Knuth’s talk. I found it a very interesting concept.</p>

<p>It spoke to me as a “humanizing” way to write code, and as someone who branched out from the humanities and social sciences into a more STEM oriented field, I really appreciate efforts like this that bridge the gulf and try to consider the human element in areas/fields where the human element is often pushed aside.</p>

<p>Knuth referenced times he’d looked back at old code and couldn’t remember what he’d done; I found this painfully funny, an experience I’ve had more times than I’d care to admit in the past couple years. From my own experiences with that frustration, I’ve learned to take a little time to write comments into my code, even if the probability is low that anyone else (myself included) will look at it again. In that way, I’ve incorporated some of literate programming into my coding practices, already.</p>

<p>As I’m approaching the end of my tenure as a master’s student, I can appreciate literate programming as a good best practice, especially as I work on tackling my largest coding project so far. By writing notes to a possible audience that includes my future self, I’ve taken some steps towards incorporating literate programming into my work. But as I undertake this big final project, I think I can continue to in this direction and further improve my coding practice by incorporating the practice of writing code in chunks/modules in addition to leaving good comments/notes.</p>
