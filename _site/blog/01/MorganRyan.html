    <h1 class="post-title">Literate Programming...</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <h2 id="background">Background:</h2>

<p>I thought that Dr. Knuth’s presentation on literate programming was quite interesting.  While I haven’t used literate programming before, 
I could definitely see myself wanting to use it in the future. One of the more frustrating things that always seems to happen when I’m 
trying to complete an assignment is I don’t document my work very well. In Dr. Knuth’s lecture, he said that literate programming is a 
way of trying to write code not just for the computer to read, but for other people to read. He used the example of how sometimes he 
comes back to a program he wrote ten years prior and needs to try and understand what is going on in his code, so using literate 
programming is useful because it is easy to read the code and recollect what was being written ten years earlier. While I don’t have any
code that I wrote ten years ago, literate programming would help me find my train of thought on a program that I was working on ten 
minutes ago. With literate programming, it would be easier for me to remember what it was I was trying to do by being able to actual 
read the code, rather than trying to remember what I meant when labeling things “test,” “test1,” “testing,” or “answer.”</p>

<p>Another instance when it would be useful for me to use literate programming is on our lab reports for Stat585. Dr. Knuth mentioned that 
literate programming is useful when working in a group, which makes a lot of sense. Working on a lab project as a group would be much 
easier if groups made a real effort to document what they were doing and why. I’m usually pretty bad at making my work clear to read- 
when I really get going on a project I just want to get to the next step or find the answer instead of slowing down and documenting my 
work. Group projects would go a lot better (and groups I work in would probably appreciate it) if I made an effort to use literate 
programming in the future.</p>
