    <h1 class="post-title">Literate Programming...</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Until I was introduced to <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Literate-Programming">this video</a> by Dr. Knuth, I have never heard about the term called “literate programming”.  Although I never heard about the term, it was a surprise to me that I was already practicing the concept of literate programming (at least to some extent). The following topics are why I like literate programming and how I could utilize literate programming for my career.</p>

<h3 id="easy-way-to-communicate-with-your-peers">Easy way to communicate with your peers</h3>
<p>I am currently working on a project that involves researchers with academic discipline outside statistics or computer science. Since programming languages are different from one field to another, communication and reproducibility was an issue among my group members. Literate programming was one of the great solutions for this problem since one could explain their thought flows and show the corresponding code chunk with an example. This allowed group members not only to understand how other members were working, but also to learn computer languages and codes that they never knew before.</p>

<h3 id="to-keep-track-of-my-work">To keep track of my work</h3>
<p>If the code is written a while ago or if one is referring to a script from another source that he/she has written in the past, these computer codes may be difficult to read/track even to the person who wrote it. During Dr. Knuth’s talk (around 23 minutes into the video), he talked about making reference of other modules/fragments of code. This inspired me much since I had experiences getting lost when writing a large script that involves multiple modules from another source. With literate programming, I could simply make references to these fragments of code and find them when in need.</p>

<h3 id="makes-writing-easier">Makes writing easier</h3>
<p>It has been a while since I have been using Rmarkdown or LaTeX for my school work. One thing I liked the most is that I could compile code chunks and documents at the same time. This is great because writing my homework is now much easier since I could plot graphs and images in my document directly with embed code chunks.</p>
