  <article class="post-content">
    <p><em>Literate Programming</em>, as the name suggests is an approach to writing a program in the form of literature which can be understood by human beings. It is first introduced by Donald E. Knuth whose main intention is to make a person understand what is the logic behind a particular piece of code. The main motivation behind this is to explain things behind a particular program or a piece of code in simpler and interactive ways. In his talk, Donald E. Knuth talks about a number of examples in which literate programming has made reading programs very easy and interactive including books on MP3 format, TEX web program, and Complier design and implementation.</p>

<p>In his talk, Donald E. Knuth talks about the <strong>“paradox of open system”</strong>. He talks about this in the context of the various open source projects that are being run and how difficult it is to use or code for such projects due to lack of proper documentation and structure of the code. Each person working on an open source project has his own writing style and going through their code without any background is very difficult. As most of the tools in the field of bioinformatics are open source, the documentation and code structure is not very well maintained. I have frequently faced these issues while working on various tools. Even the big projects such as <a href="https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal">cBioportal</a> (Database to store cancer Single Nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset) doesn’t have a very good code structure and it is very difficult to make contributions in such projects.</p>

<p>Many times, in his talk Donald E. Knuth talks about how literal programming not only help others in understanding your code but even yourself. I had faced similar issues when I tried to understand my code which I had written a while back. I have a habit of modularizing my code and writing comments but still, it is not enough to fully understand it after some time. Being a bioinformatics graduate student, it is our responsibility to write scripts and code which can be understood and used by whole bioinformatics community. I think literal programming will help me in achieving this goal and in future, I would try to incorporate it into my programming.</p>
