    <h1 class="post-title">Literate Programming</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The term “Literate Programming” was foreign to me before this exercise, but after watching Donald Knuth’s talk, I can recognize how I have been incorporating the main ideas of literate programming into my coding recently. Having the separate code and text components in Rmarkdown has encouraged me to approach projects in a manner similar to what Knuth described.</p>

<p>While I often begin a project with this approach in mind, there regularly comes a point where I abandon the effort for the sake of time. Naturally, this is also the point of the assignment that I find to be the most difficult. After listening to Knuth’s discussion on Literate Programming, I understand that it would actually be advantageous for me to continue thoroughly documenting my code at this point in the assignment.</p>

<p>Literate Programming can help on many levels: it ensures you and others can actually read the code, it helps with the debugging process, it can help you understand what your next step in the coding process is, and it can assist in helping you understand the results of the coding exercise. In addition, a literate program provides an excellent reference point for any similar program you may need to write in the future.</p>

<p>While I don’t know that I’ll ever find reading code to be an enjoyable process, it certainly does not need to be a painful one. I think most of us understand that thoroughly documenting our code will help others to understand it, but few are motivated to actually go through with the practice - whether it is due to a time-crunch, laziness, or another lousy excuse. I really appreciated that Knuth emphasized how, through consistent practice, literate programming will eventually help you write better code faster and can enable you to tackle more difficult programming tasks.</p>
