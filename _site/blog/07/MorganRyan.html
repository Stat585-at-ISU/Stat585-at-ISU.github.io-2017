  <article class="post-content">
    <h2 id="background">Background:</h2>

<p>The retracted Science paper <code class="highlighter-rouge">When contact changes minds</code> and the surrounding problems are discussed in detail in form of a  <a href="https://www.unh.edu/research/sites/www.unh.edu.research/files/docs/RIS/lacour_case.pdf">case study</a> on Responsible Conduct of Research by the Research Office of the University of New Hampshire. Read through the case study (and maybe try to find out some more of the details on the case).</p>

<p>At the end of the case study, several questions are raised. Pick one of the questions and write a blog post discussing it. Make sure to state which question you are answering.</p>

<p>##Question 1: How do you think LaCour was able to publish falsified data in such a prestigious journal as <em>Science</em>?</p>

<p>I think there are a few factors that contributed to Science publishing an article based on falsified data. The first of these factors is its possible <em>Science</em> wanted to “break the news” with the findings. Clearly, the results went viral quickly, since the study’s findings contradicted mainstream thinking. The article says that the results “made a huge splash in the national media.” It would make sense why <em>Science</em> would want to publish supposed huge news. Another factor is <em>Science</em> put too much trust in the peer review process. In an interview (<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/fake-study-make-science-magazine/">found here</a>), Ivan Oransky (co-founder of <em>Retraction Watch</em>) says that peer review isn’t as reliable as many think. Oranksy said that scientists are “under a lot of pressure” and that peer review “has a lot of holes.”</p>

<p>Along with mistakenly trusting the peer review process, it is likely that <em>Science</em> placed a lot of trust in Donald Green, the political science professor who co-authored the study. After searching online, I found that Green won the Heinz I. Eulau Award for best article published in the American Political Science Review during 2009. I think it is likely that other researchers who read the <em>When Contact Changes Minds</em> paper trusted the results since Green was willing to put his name on it. Green was clearly respected by his peers, so the peer review process might not have been intense for his article as it would have been for other authors. Along with the journal placing too much trust in Green, Green obviously placed too much trust in LaCour to not lie about his data.</p>

<p>I think another possible factor in why <em>Science</em> published the falsified data was that the results (wrongly, as it turned out) confirmed something that people wanted to believe. There is something appealing in the idea that having a level headed conversation with someone who disagrees with you can change their opinion. When I read an ESPN article about why the Chicago Cubs are the best team in baseball, I like the article and want to pass it on to my friends. The article supports something that I already want to believe. I think a small reason the article was able to be published is that people wanted to believe the results, even though the article turned out to be false.</p>
