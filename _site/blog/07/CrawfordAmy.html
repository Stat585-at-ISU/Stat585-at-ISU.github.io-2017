  <article class="post-content">
    <h2 id="background">Background:</h2>

<p>The retracted Science paper <code class="highlighter-rouge">When contact changes minds</code> and the surrounding problems are discussed in detail in form of a  <a href="https://www.unh.edu/research/sites/www.unh.edu.research/files/docs/RIS/lacour_case.pdf">case study</a> on Responsible Conduct of Research by the Research Office of the University of New Hampshire. Read through the case study (and maybe try to find out some more of the details on the case).</p>

<p>At the end of the case study, several questions are raised. Pick one of the questions and write a blog post discussing it. Make sure to state which question you are answering.</p>

<h3 id="question-10-what-are-some-of-the-consequences-of-lacours-behavior-for-boockman-and-kalla-for-green-for-other-researchers-in-this-field-for-ucla-for-activists">Question 10: What are some of the consequences of LaCour’s behavior? For Boockman and Kalla? For Green? For other researchers in this field? For UCLA? For activists?</h3>

<p>There are wide reaching consequences of LaCour’s behaivior. It is extremely dissapointing that someone would do such a thing as manipulate data to generate results that “directly contradicted mainstream thinking at the time”. He had to have known what a splash these results would have in the media and how others would change their course of action because of the paper. It was a careless and irresponsible thing to do.</p>

<p>Dr. Green, “a prominent political scientist”, probably lost some credibility in his field. Since he was brought on to help with statistical interpretations of the experimental design it is quite concerning that he didn’t see the red flags. This falsified result has concequences of Boockman, Kalla, and other researchers in the field because many of them spent time and money building upon LaCour’s findings. After the paper was retracted many researchers probably had to reconsider their course of research. Grant funding was shifted because of the result of the paper and consequences of its retraction must have been very dissapointing for researchers and activists both. Funding was most likely shifted away from the topic of <em>attitude change</em> and researchers who were conducting follow-up experiments and working to extend ideas from LeCour’s results would have had to completely change gears and reroute their research.</p>

<p>Activists who changed their approach to voter outreach must have been extremely angry and dissapointed. They beleived that this method of outreach was having a much bigger impact than it truly did and they could have spent time and resources using other methods to reach voters. The consequences for UCLA were worsened (in my opinion) when LeCour tried to back-pedal and claimed that he only falsified his funding source, the amount of compensation for participants, deleting raw data, and changing survey companies. Those actions on their own are unacceptable, but on top of it all the “raw data” was found to be a manipulated copy of the 2012 CCAP dataset and the results. To have this fiasco emerge from UCLA must discredit the program/institution to and extent (at least for some people).</p>
