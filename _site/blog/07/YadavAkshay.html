<p>One of the biggest mentoring issues here, I think, is that Green did not know every specific detail of the study. It looks like he was involved only in high-level data analytics and completely trusted LaCour with raw data collection and storage. Had he been involved in every small task of the project, he could have detected the inconsistencies and the study wouldn’t have been published. This is also evident from the fact that Green could not independently defend the study when Broockman and Kalla wrote to Green. He had to contact LaCour for a reponse to Broockman and Kalla’s report.</p>

<p>Prominent and senior scientists should get as involved as possible in their students’ projects and should not refrain from actual hands-on work, especially if the results of the studies are ground-breaking and expected to attract a lot of attention from the scientific community</p>
