  <li>What data management issues does this case raise?</li>
</ol>

<p>The retracted article “When contact changes minds: An experiment on transmission of support for gay equality” published on Science reminds us many problems in research, not only the peer review or mentoring responsibility, but also some data management issues. Data are vital to the quality and reliability of research, especially for the quantitative fields like statistics. Several deficiencies are identified by the case study:</p>

<p>(1)	The graduate student (LaCour) who conducts the work deleted the raw data. The raw data used for analysis should be available for other researchers to test or reproduce the results. Even if not to the public, the raw data should be available to at least internal administrative people who have privilege for it. There might be some concerns about UCLA’s requirements to protect the identity of study participants. However, according to the UCLA guidelines, identification information can be deleted, but not all data. The fact that LaCour deleted all the data to protect the participants’ identification information is a severe mistake.</p>

<p>(2)	LaCour’s supervisor, Green, helped LaCour write up the findings, especially the parts that had to do with the statistical interpretation of the experimental design. He stated that he did not have IRB approval for the study from his home institution, so he didn’t analyze any primary data. Firstly, the supervisor was too easily to get convinced about the results without seeing the raw data and without knowing how the data used for analysis were obtained from the raw data. Secondly, Green can asked for some experts in the UCLA who have the privilege to the raw data to check the analysis on behalf of him, even when he doesn’t have the IRB approval from his institution. At last, the institutions should consider setup regulations for the check of data integrity under such kind of situations, so that students under similar circumstances can follow in the future.</p>

<p>(3)	The institution of the graduate student, UCLA, should conduct a basic check about the data before the manuscript can be submitted. To me, the institution should be responsible for storing the raw data too. In this case, the raw data has been completely deleted and non-tractable, which is almost impossible to be accepted and let the manuscript out for review. Therefore, when other researchers require the data, even the authors have intentionally or unintentionally delete the data, the institution still has a copy.</p>

<p>Data management is a very broad topic and involve many policymaking procedures, nevertheless, some basic requirements should be complied to for better and more reliable research.</p>
