<h4 id="the-asa-sections-on-statistical-graphics-and-statistical-computing-are-hosting-a-video-library-of-movies-showcasing-the-state-of-the-art-of-the-times-this-library-contains-countless-interesting-insights-into-the-history-of-computing-and-graphics-watch-jwtukey-demonstrate-the--prim-9-system">The ASA sections on Statistical Graphics and Statistical Computing are hosting a <a href="http://stat-graphics.org/movies/">video library</a> of movies showcasing the ‘state of the art’ of the times. This library contains countless interesting insights into the history of computing and graphics. Watch J.W.Tukey demonstrate the  <a href="http://stat-graphics.org/movies/prim9.html">Prim-9 system</a>.</h4>

<h4 id="in-the-light-of-this-video-write-a-blog-post-discussing-the-use-of-interactive-graphics-how-have-you-experienced-interactive-statistical-graphics-and-in-which-systems-what-operations-do-you-consider-to-be-part-of-interactive-statistical-graphics-now">In the light of this video, write a blog post discussing the use of interactive graphics: how have you experienced interactive statistical graphics (and in which systems)? What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now?</h4>

<hr />

<p>I found it to be fascinating that many of the main concepts in interactive graphics haven’t changed tremendously since John Tukey discussed the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Prim-9</code> hardware. What has changed tremendously, however, is how accessible the interactive graphics are and the ease at which today’s interactive graphics can be customized and made to look nicer/neater. While the underlying concepts of interactive graphics are similar, the visual outputs are remarkably different. I have found this progression of the visual aspect of interactive graphics to be particularly pleasing. I thoroughly enjoy perusing d3 creations online and admire data-driven generative art pieces.</p>

<p>My exposure to creating interactive graphics has been mostly through <code class="highlighter-rouge">ggvis</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ggplotly</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">shiny</code>. The primary motivation in using these tools for creating interactive graphics has been to highlight interesting data, uncover hidden insights, or to filter the data. I do hope that my exposure to interactive graphics is just beginning.</p>

<p>Tukey defined the four essentails as picturing, rotation, isolation, and masking and added that these four essentails need to work together. I think for interactive graphics to be useful they need to be easy to apply to many situations and easy to reproduce. If the interactive graphic achieves this, it can be used for both exploratory data analysis and as a way to display results in an audience engaging manner.</p>
