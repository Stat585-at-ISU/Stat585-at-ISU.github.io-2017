    <h2 id="background">Background:</h2>

<p>The ASA sections on Statistical Graphics and Statistical Computing are hosting a <a href="http://stat-graphics.org/movies/">video library</a> of movies showcasing the ‘state of the art’ of the times. This library contains countless interesting insights into the history of computing and graphics. Watch J.W.Tukey demonstrate the  <a href="http://stat-graphics.org/movies/prim9.html">Prim-9 system</a>.</p>

<p>In the light of this video, write a blog post discussing the use of interactive graphics: how have you experienced interactive statistical graphics (and in which systems)? What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now?</p>

<h1>#</h1>
<p>I have experiences statistical graphics mostly after coming to school at Iowa State, especially during the last election. The way that websites allow users to interact with their data makes it much more approachable, interesting, and understandable. I went to graphics group when Carson was presenting to practice for his PhD defense and saw plotly used extensively for one of the first times. It was awesome and I saw cross talk for the first time. I have personally worked with interactive graphics the most in this class. I enjoy playing with plotly. I think that it is an exetremely useful tool to give important information in a great graphic. The only system I have experienced interactive graphics on is <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> (I think).</p>

<p>What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now? 
The operations I consider to be part of an interactive statistical graphics are the ability to filter data, rotate data,  and tailor/customize a potentially complex plot to answer an interesting scientific question. The idea (for me) behind a successful interactive graphic is the ability to gain additional information from a static visual.</p>
