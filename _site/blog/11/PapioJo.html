    <h2 id="background-how-have-you-experienced-interactive-statistical-graphics-and-in-which-systems-what-operations-do-you-consider-to-be-part-of-interactive-statistical-graphics-now">Background: How have you experienced interactive statistical graphics (and in which systems)? What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now?</h2>

<p>With the exponential increase in computing power, statistical graphics and data visualization has obviously come a very long way in the last forty some years (to say nothing of the production and aesthetic judgements for creating video presentations). Given Tukey’s excitement about the <strong>PRIM-9</strong>’s abilities to expand our consideration and perspective via visualization, one can only imagine how excited he would be with our current capabilities.</p>

<p>Today, we have awesome real time interactive graphic solutions like plotly and ggvis and ggobi and shiny, all of which are incredibly useful. But with how quickly we can run code to get varied outputs via changing options and layers and geoms through packages like ggplot, surely even that would seem “interactive” compared with the tools Tukey had available during his day.</p>

<p>However, one thing that I find interesting is the “seriousness” (or lack thereof) with which some in the field of Statistics (especially those of the <em>theory</em> variety) treat visualization and computing and data science. And yet Tukey is hardly a “soft” statistician, having had incredibly influence on the field. And he was applying the <strong>PRIM-9</strong> to data from partical physics, hardly a “soft” science.</p>

<p>Clearly in Tukey’s application in the video, and more broadly, the use of visualization and interactive graphics can facilitate understanding data beyond two or even three dimensions, something which is often rather difficult to wrap one’s head around, especially when it’s not something you’ve spent a lot of time thinking about it. But good visualization tools can be incredibly powerful in helping to overcome that stumbling block, illuminating tihngs present in the data which might not be seen otherwise, as Tukey points out in the video.</p>
