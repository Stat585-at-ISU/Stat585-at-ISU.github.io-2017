  <article class="post-content">
    <p>So yes I have built a package before but I never formalized it. It was produced while I was an intern at Oak Ridge lab where I built a few functions that takes files being produced at the end of one cycle for a program running on Titan. It did a lot of things but the big thing was that I built it as a package to allow for easy use for other’s needing to get a hold of the data in an organized format. As far as I know it is still being used in conjunction with another program. The thing is though that since it was for local use only I never really tried to clean it up to the point where it was readable to anyone else or even really document what is happening. This is not a good thing all in all and I realize that now. As for profiling the code that went alright. We had a loop that we neveer successfully got rid of and as usual there was memory allocation programs. I have never dealt with CRAN before and from what I have heard they kind of scare me with the amount of corrections they will send. As for the one we built in class I was annoyed at the amount of time it took to get rid of the warnings. So many small things that had to be dug up and corrected. But all in all I like the easy that packages allow for a work group to combine their individual parts. Soooo much better thn emails with 80 different versions flying around.</p>
