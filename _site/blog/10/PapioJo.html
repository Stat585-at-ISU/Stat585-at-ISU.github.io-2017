    <h2 id="statisticians-first-r-package">Statistician’s First R Package</h2>

<p>Honestly, the whole process still seems a bit daunting. The “package” we pretended to submit (ran the devtools check on) for the lab was fairly rudimentary, since the function and dataset we used were very basic. But having gone through the motions and seen each of the steps, I feel confident that I can break the process into smaller, more tractable pieces when the time comes.</p>

<p>One of the biggest difficulties was getting the Roxygen comments to create the documentation correctly. I think I wasn’t formatting them properly. But with more time to go over a broader set of more extensive examples, I think I can figure out what wasn’t working before and how to get it right this time.</p>

<p>One of the things the process impressed upon me is to do Rstudio/package updates as soon as possible, rather than putting them off for the sake of momentary convenience. Having the most up to date Rstudio version appears to make the whole process of submission slightly smoother than if your installation of Rstudio is out of date.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I wish I’d had a better feel for this process earlier. As with many things in this couse, there are best practices that people have spent time developing (and earned battle scars in the process to prove it) that make a lot of sense. But without having been exposed to those earlier in my coursework, I spent (wasted) a lot of time figuring things out on my own, learning bad habits along the way that are hard to unlearn. Just like with other processes (data management, file naming, coding with an audience in mind), there are things I could have done along the way as I was writing my functions that would have made the overall process smoother. But since I’ve been more diligent about documenting as I code, I think it won’t be too painful to collect the information I need as I go through the CRAN submission process.</p>

<p>I’ll be finalizing my package for submission soon, and at that point, I hope I don’t have an interesting story to tell.</p>
