<p>By now all of you have collected some experience in writing an R package. How did that go? What were the difficulties? Have you got a story to share about a CRAN submission that went particularly well (or not)?</p>

<p>The lab we did last week is the only experience I had so far with writing an R package. It’s still an intimidating process for me, but what we did in the lab helped so much for me to understand the entire process, and I am also amazed how helpful the different folers and files are. Couple difficulties we ran into: 1. writing the roxygen comments. We understood the purpose of the comments, but still it took some guidance and help to write it. 2. writing the README.md file. We have not seen a .md file before, so how to write it and how to put it on Github was a challenge. However, it makes the documentation much better when we figured out how get it working. Overall, I think the entire process went well, and helped me a lot. I do not have any CRAN submission, but I believe as I keep using R more and start to practice on making packages, I may have a story to shre some day.</p>
