    <p><strong>What are intervals, durations, periods, and instants?</strong>
It is easiest to start by defining an instant and going from there. An instant is a specific moment in time. An example of this would be the time I was born, May 31st, 1993 at 11:45pm, or the time that my sister was born, June 30th, 1996 at 2:30pm. Intervals, durations, and periods are a bit more tricking because they are all ways of recording time spans. An interval is a span of time that occurs between two instants. For example, the interval between my sister and myself being born is 1993-05-31 – 1996-06-30. The length of that interval is 1126 days. A duration is an <em>exact</em> time span measured in seconds. In other words, a duration is not affected by leap years, leap seconds, and daylight savings time. A period is a <em>non-exact</em> time span measured in larger units than seconds, like minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years, and is affected by leap years, leap seconds, and daylight savings time. The duration between my birth date and my sister’s birth date is 97253100s (~3.08 years) and the period between them is 3 years, 0 months, 29 days, 14 hours, 45 minutes and 0 seconds. The period is affected by the leap year that was between us but the duration is not.</p>

<p><strong>(Why) do we need these distinctions?</strong>
We need these distinctions because our system of time is complicated. Date-time data create technical difficulties not seen with other types of data. Different versions of time spans are used to answer different questions. We need to understand how our data was collected and be aware of the complications that we could run into because of the variation in measurements of months, years, etc.</p>
