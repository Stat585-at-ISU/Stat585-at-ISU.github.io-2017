    <h1 class="post-title">Licenses in R</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Assume you are the author of a successful and popular R package. Which license would you pick? Write a blog post discussing some of the pros (and cons) of the license. Discuss what would happen if a software company wants to use the package as part of their code and sell a product. What happens if the code doesn’t work as expected and a user tries to sue you?</p>

<p>After reading throught the licenses at https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/ I would pick the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2. I like that this license ensures access to source code becuase allowing users to have access to this code can expedite research and benefits this large R community as a whole. I think it is important with this license that if the software is copied and modified, the subsequent recipients of the software are aware that the copy they have is not the original. This way, if they get a “broken” copy of the software it does not reflect poorly on the author.</p>

<p>This license also allows for the software to remain “free” with regard to freedom, but not price. If there ever was a situation when a company would want to use the package as part of their code to sell a product, I would be allowed to be compensated accordingly. I like this because companies who use the software for profit can be billed while others still have access because the software would never be able to become proprietary. The last thing that I really prefered about this license is that if a user wants to incorporate parts of the software into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, they must write to the author to ask for permission.</p>
