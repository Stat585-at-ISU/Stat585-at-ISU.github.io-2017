    <h3 id="which-license-would-you-pick-write-a-blog-post-discussing-some-of-the-pros-and-cons-of-the-license-discuss-what-would-happen-if-a-software-company-wants-to-use-the-package-as-part-of-their-code-and-sell-a-product-what-happens-if-the-code-doesnt-work-as-expected-and-a-user-tries-to-sue-you">Which license would you pick? Write a blog post discussing some of the pros (and cons) of the license. Discuss what would happen if a software company wants to use the package as part of their code and sell a product. What happens if the code doesn’t work as expected and a user tries to sue you?</h3>

<p>If I had completed a project worthy of publishing, I would probably pick the GNU General Public License v3. At least in an academic setting, my goal of
a project would be to learn and help others learn. This license would preserve the ability of others to see and learn from the original code 
and also removes all personal liability. The license also clearly states there is no warranty associated with the code.</p>

<p>A downside of this license is that it appears to be a lot more strict than licenses like the MIT license. 
Modifications to the code come with the several licensing requirements, user’s rights can be terminated in some
circumstances, and it’s not easy to sort through all the details and legal jargon. I don’t quite understand all
the details in the Patents section, which would be extremely important if a company wanted to use an sell parts of the code.
I would definitly want to consult with someone that had a better understanding of licenses and the law before officially committing to using the GNU GPL 3.</p>
