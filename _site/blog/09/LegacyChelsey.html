  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Background:
Assume you are the author of a successful and popular R package. Which license would you pick? Write a blog post discussing some of the pros (and cons) of the license. Discuss what would happen if a software company wants to use the package as part of their code and sell a product. What happens if the code doesn’t work as expected and a user tries to sue you?</p>

<p>For my R package I would choose to use the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 License. This license would allow me to distribute copies of the program, at charge if I wish. It also ensure that the source code for the software will always be available for both me and the users of the package I create.  This license would allow the company to use the package as a part of their code and sell the products for cost.  The license mentions that there is no warranty for the program and that the owner of the license is not liable if the user does not properly use the software or if data is lost in the process of using the software.  This license doesn’t specifically mention what would happen if the code does not work as the user expected (that I could located in the passage). If I were concerned about this, I would choose the MIT License instead, which is much less detailed, but removes the liability from the initial package creator.</p>
