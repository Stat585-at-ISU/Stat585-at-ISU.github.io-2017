  <article class="post-content">
    <h2 id="license-in-r">License in R</h2>
<p>I think I will pick “GNU General Public License” version 3. First of all, the GPL-3 license could allow users to share and use the software freely. They could access the source code of software and change the code according to their will as long as they do not publish it. It also protects the authors’ rights in several aspects. The authors have their freedom to charge for the software or not. The author has the rights to keep the copy of the software or modify it. Besides, if anyone publishes a modified version of original software, the new version should be marked as changed. In this case, the authors may not be sued if the software does not work as expected. When I am publishing a software, I will try to clarify the limitation of this software and possible problems when using this software to avoid causing users problem. The license also solves the compatibility problem with other licenses. And this version has updates about the software patent. This version of license also protects the user by prohibit the device that does not allow users to install modified version of software. However, the author could be sued if the software does not work as expected. There is another serious problem of GPL is that if the patch is published with GPL-3, but the original software is published with GPL-2，the patch might be incompatible with the software.</p>
