## Prompt:


The `plyr` package has by now been replaced by other, even faster packages, but the idea of *Split, apply, combine* is as relevant as ever.

Read the paper [The Split-Apply-Combine Strategy for Data Analysis](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01) by Hadley Wickham.


Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Which (base R) functions do you know that support the split-apply-combine strategy? In your opinion, are these sufficient - state why or why not?**. 
2. **Using a dataset of your choice, describe how you can use the split-apply-combine strategy for a prt of the data analysis.**
