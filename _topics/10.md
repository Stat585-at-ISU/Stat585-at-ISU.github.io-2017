## Background:

By now all of you have collected some experience in writing an R package. How did that go? What were the difficulties? Have you got a story to share about a CRAN submission that went particularly well (or not)?

Write a blog post on your experience. 

## Instructions:

Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.


{% assign num_posts = site.blog | size %}
{% if num_posts > 0 %}
## Class posts:

<ul>
{% for post in site.blog %}
  {% if page.topic == post.topic %}
  <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }} by {{ post.author }}</a></li>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endif %}
