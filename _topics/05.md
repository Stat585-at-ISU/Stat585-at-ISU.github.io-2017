## Background:

In class, we have briefly touched on working with S3 objects. There are various online sources on this subject available, e.g. Hadley Wickham's chapter on [S3 objects](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html#s3), Cyclismo's [tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/s3Classes.html), Abishek Tiwari's [blog post](https://abhishek-tiwari.com/hacking/class-and-objects-in-r-s3-style), ...


Write a blog post addressing **one** of these topics:

- At an S3 class of your choice discuss a set of functions/methods/approaches that allow you to interact with the class. Make sure to give plenty of examples!
- Explain how a user can define a new S3 class with objects and methods at a small example of your choice.
