## Background:

In his 1995 paper [WaveLab and Reproducible Research ](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~donoho/Reports/1995/wavelab.pdf) David L Donoho is making a case for reproducible research. About 15 years laters, Donoho is re-evaluating the situation of reproducible research in the paper [15 Years of Reproducible Research in Computational Harmonic Analysis](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~donoho/Reports/2008/15YrsReproResch-20080426.pdf).

Based on these two papers, write a blog post discussing the commonalities and changes in the themes and solutions.
