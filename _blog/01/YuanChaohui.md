Basically the concept of literate programming is absolutely new to me, even I've been using 
latex for a long time. The reason that I like LaTex because it produces super-nice mathmatical 
formula and it saves me a lot of time for adjusting the format like word. Everything has been formatted properly and automatically. It can be customized by the useer as well. It is opensource in terms of people can develop it as they need. 


I think one benefit from literate programming would be making research work reproducible and easy to keep tracking what have been done and share the documents to other people. For example, Rmarkdown and knitr would be two examples of incorporating literate programming tool into R language to generate dynamic statistical reports.  In my reseach, I am using knitr a lot for writing up reports, and it's easier for me to keep tracking and making records for my work.
