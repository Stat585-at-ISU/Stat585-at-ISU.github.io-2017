Something I found really interesting that he did in his book was to use the really nice "blurb -> code" where he would give a 
paragraph giving you the general attack pattern of what the following does and then  he writes the code in some language 
in something that maybe looks like psudeo-code.

"Simple modules connected in simple ways". I like that quote from him, it seems like a good way to build up a complicated program.
I have never had to do it before but just getting the small isolated pieces done a little bit at a time and making them all mesh. 
I know I have been in trouble before when I try to write one really long complicated come instead of just breaking it up into
small readable pieces. Or when I try to cram them together it's just one giant mess trying to get from one part to another. 
 
I also liked the page cross-references that the guys doing the book on rendering did. If I ever write code that massive I feel 
like that could be a really useful idea, my gut says an index also would be pretty helpful. I also really, really like the use 
of <> to represent there is another code you need to find. Let's the work flow better than "Oh, by the way here's a new function
we need to build" and getting off track. I feel for extremely short programs for personal use it would be fine to skip maybe but if I had 
something fairly lengthy I would definitely use that method of chunk breaking. 

I don't think I have ever done anything to check for parameters before in all honesty. I just learned some better coding techniques.
This was actually a really nice talk once I got into it. I also now feel shameful for the terrible code I have
written in the past where I am uncertain of what it does looking back.
