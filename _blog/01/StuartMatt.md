## How I Have Used Literate Programming:

Currently, I am a research assistant under the Center for Survey Statistics and Methodology working on a Pet Demographic Survey.  Our team was recently required to write a report on our progress.  It was originally started under Microsoft Word, but since we discovered we would need to include a few charts and tables, it was clear I needed to learn LaTex to get up to speed on a better way to write a report.  

After we began using LaTex, I learned that in terms of writing a document, it was much simpler to use than Word.  So, I began writing homework assignments in LaTex as well as using Beamer to write a presentation for our survey working group.  Ever since, I have stopped using Word and using LaTex to write all of my homework assignments in which I don't use pen and paper.

Also, STAT 579, as you all know, is about learning R and RMarkdown.  After writing the first couple of assignments in R and Word, I realized that RMarkdown combined the best of both R and LaTex when writing documents, so using that made doing my assignments in that class much less complicated.

## How I Will Use Literate Programming:

Going forward, I will continue to use RMarkdown for documents in which I use R Code for weekly presentations for our survey team.  I will also use Markdown for homework assignments that use R Code as well.  Finally, LaTex and Markdown will be heavily used for my research when I am a graduate student still, such as my creative component and my dissertation.
