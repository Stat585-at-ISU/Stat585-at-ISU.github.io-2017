I enjoyed watching Donald Knuth speak about literate programming. I wasn't great at explaining or even commenting my code in previous years. I started to improve over the summer during my internship. I was launching a project and knew I would be passing it on to someone in the department when the summer was over. I didn't know at the time, but I was making use of literate programming in my work. I worked almost exclusively in rmarkdown (when they didn't make me use SAS), and would write my code chunks between paragraphs explaining my workflow, the direction I was trying to go with the project, and my thoughts. I found out quickly that this was a great way to communicate my work to my supervisor and business partners. I found that with this structure, I could present my work to a person with varying technical or coding knowledge because my words were mixed nicely with code, tables, and graphs.

In the future I would like to integrate this style of coding into most of what I write, especially while I work on my creative component. I am very slow when I write code like this, but as Donald Knuth pointed out, there are usually fewer bugs in the code this way.  Writing code in a manner that others (and future me) will be able look back and quickly understand what is happening, will become increasingly important and valuable as I begin to tackle substantial projects during the semester.
