I think literate programming is a very good way to write computational code with comments and a clear way to combine the codes 
with the author's thoughts in the readable version. As Donald Knuth mentioned in the video, rather than writing the code in a 
computational logic or mathematics logic, it’s better and more clear to write the code in the order we’d like to think.


I started learning R in my first year of Grad School. The old way I composed my homework or project was to copy and paste the 
report to a Word document,and typed my explanation of my answer into the document later. It was not a very good way to compelet 
the work considering the effiency. I haven't thought about changing my style until the course 544. I learned how to use R 
Markdown in that class. It saved me a lot time on doing all my assignments. And as I learned from some of my classmates, using 
LaTeX is actually very easy and can save a lot time even more, even if it looks hard at the first glance. I never used LaTeX 
before, but I want to give a try in the future to do my homework, project and creative componet.
