I had not encountered literate programming before watching this talk by Knuth.  I have always commented code as a way of explaining what is happening in code chunks.  I have even used Latex and written about code with code chunks added into text for various projects.  However, I have not weaved the text into the code exactly as Knuth’s examples demonstrated.  I think this could be very helpful for presenting work for publications or when working on future group projects for clarifications about complex code chunks.

After watching this video and seeing all the resources available for helping with literate programming, I anticipate trying to learn new methods and improve this skill for years to come.  I think it’s a remarkably useful skill that every statistician and programmer should be able to do well if they want to be able to share their work with others.  I look forward to studying this more in this course and learning new ways to get better at commenting and explaining code in a neat format that readers can enjoy “by a fire” like Knuth jokes in his talk.
