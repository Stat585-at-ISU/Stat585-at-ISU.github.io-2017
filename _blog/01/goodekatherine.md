This is the first time I have heard the term "literate programming". When I think about what role "literate programming" has played in my life, it makes me wonder where the line falls between commenting code and "literate programming". When I write code for homework assignments, I try to make comments that briefly explain the code, but the explanations are not as detailed as the text sections in Donald Knuth's examples. When I write code for consulting clients, I include more detailed comments, so the client is able to understand what the code is doing. However, the code is not turned into a book type document with text and code intermixed, so this does not seem to count as "literate programming".

I think the closest that I have come to "literate programming" is when I am interacting with code (reading or writing) that I am struggling to understand. For example, if a professor provides code for performing a statistical procedure that is new and confusing to me, I may copy the code into a LaTeX file, and I will go through function by function and write text describing what is happening. It helps me to understand both the procedure and code, and I can refer back to it in the future. In his talk, Knuth mentioned that "literate programming" allowed him to write code that would have been too complex to wrap his mind around otherwise. From my experiences making use of a lower level of "literate programming" to understand new concepts and code presented to me, I can understand what he means.

I feel as though much of the code that I write on a day to day basis is not "grand" enough to warrant making use of "literate programming". (Perhaps others would argue otherwise.) However, going forward in my PhD and career afterwards, I can see where making use of "literate programming" would be advantageous. If I am writing code for a project that is more substantial than a homework assignment or that may be used by other people, it seems incredibly beneficial to have an organized document that details the procedure implemented by the code. As Knuth points out, this type of document allows the writer to better organize their thoughts while writing, provides a reference later on, and allows other people to read and comprehend the code in an easy manner. These all seem like great benefits, especially when working with collaborators and open source programming languages such as R.
