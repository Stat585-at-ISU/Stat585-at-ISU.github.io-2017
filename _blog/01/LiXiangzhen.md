Literate programmingÂ is a way of programming that use logic and human readable words to organize the code. As Dr. Knuth mentioned in the lecturer, we should consider programming as literature. We not only write codes to computer, also people to read it. It also makes programming understandable.

I learned several programming courses in college. I have used C and SQL in the past. However, all that I learned is real basic application of these language. When I learned these language, I did not make use of literate programming, not even wrote logical comments. I could not understand some of the codes I wrote when I prepared for final exam of these courses. The bad habits bring me lots of trouble when I learned programming. I felt embarrassed to show my code to others, too. I thought I did not actually learned how to program with these language and forgot even the basic gramma later.

When I am learning statistics from 2015, I learned to use R which is a whole new language for me. Luckily, I was taught how to write good organized and useful comments when I learned R. For example, Prof. Kaiser taught us to write different sections of gibbs sampling so that it would be easier for ourselves to read it or share it. Now I learned literate programming from Dr. Knuth. I am appreciated it. It is a good thing to learn literate programming for a program beginner. I have been using Latex from last semester. It spends sometime when I edit it. However, I found that I could easily get information from my document. The functions is also well organized to be used in the future. I will continue to make logical and readable document in my future work. It is convenient for me to read the code and convenient to share it with other people when working as a group.
