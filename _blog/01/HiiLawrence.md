## Blog 1: Literate Programming
This is the first time for me hearing about the literate programming. In the past, I have been involved in programming from VBA, SQL to R now. One of the biggest issue with codes is documentation. Literate programming will be helpful here for programmer to write the code without worrying about documentation.

Another is that literate programming not only beneficial to programmer, also the person who executing the code. For example, writing a gibbs sampling code seems complicated. Implementing literate programming will be helpful here. Literate programming will also be helpful in teamwork or when collaborating with other people.
