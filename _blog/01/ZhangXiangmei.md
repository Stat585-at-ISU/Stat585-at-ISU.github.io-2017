Literate Programming is a new concept to me, but when I get to know TeX, which is such a great work by Donald Knuth, it seems not that far away from my life. I am a LaTeX beginner and one of the application of literate Programming is using TeX program to give homework solutions as a teaching assistance this term. I like the TeX program because it gives beautiful typesetting, especially for mathematical formulas.

As the speaker Donald Knuth said in this video, literate programming is something written not only for computers but mainly for human beings to read. I think it can produce high quality document and makes communication through papers more efficient and easier. And another advantage is that it could give exactly the same document results on all computers for every people, this is important to spread the ideas precisely. I really appreciate Knuth's work especially when I need to write a document full of matrices and complex formulas, his program makes it easier to write a professional and readable article. I am starting to write a composition about my CC project now, so I am sure I will use literate programming a lot in the future.
