## Literate Programming


 Although I've never heard of Literate Programming before watching this video, I have found myself using a
primitive variation of it to help me understand the metropolis hasting algorithm. I found it extremely helpful
to break the code apart into smaller tasks, and write a short paragraph describing what I was trying to accomplish and how
before each chunk of code. This helped me understand both the code and the algorithm.

  I see Literate Programming being most helpful when collaborating with others. Having the thoughts and intent of the original
author in addition to their code would make modifying or supplementing their code significantly easier. As Donald Knuth
also mentioned, the process of modularizing the code also ensures each task, including error handling, is given sufficient
attention and effort. I can see myself using the ideas behind Literate Programming to aid in future team projects and improve
my code through modularization.
