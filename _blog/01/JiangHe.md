I truly see the value of literature programing after Dr. Knuth talk. The first couple programing courses I took were about C and VBA, and I still remember the days that I wrote some lines that I was even not sure about, and had hard time knowning what they would do after a week, let alone sharing with others. 

However, things changed when I got to learn about R. I started to add comments besides the code, and they all come in small chuncks, like what Dr.Knuth talked - "Break paragrah into lines, and compile small modelures". It makes the code more humanly readable and easy to tract for myself and others. Now, I begin to use .rmd file and knitr more and more, I start to see the beauty of literature programing more and more. 

In the future, I plan on practicing my literature programming skill more. There is a learning curve at the beginning getting to know those some small functions, the overall flow, and the right format, but it worth the effort to make that become a habit and will benefit in the long run.
