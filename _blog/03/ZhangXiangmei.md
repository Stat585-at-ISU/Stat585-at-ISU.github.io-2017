 *How does having a grammar help with creating charts?*

I think the layered grammar of graphics is great idea to creat charts. When drawing charts the layered idea can allow us to put different components onto different layers and easily modify any part of the chart. The layers are separate, so it is much more flexible to edit component features. We can also update the chart and change or add new thing on a existing frame such as changing the color by group or add points onto a exsiting line. This layered grammar of graphics is simple to understand and use for consumers, they can express their thoughts in a relatively straight forward code language and update the chart one step by another to accomplish it exactly as they want it to be.
