As described in the abstract of the article, a grammar will allow us the "concisely describe the components of a graphic".  This is its most useful function for creating charts.  The grammar used in ggplot and gpplot2 uses a layered format, which allows the user to add onto a basic default plot. Through using the correct grammar of the plot the user has the ability to manipulate the different geom of a plot, or the the size, shape, and color of points or lines on a plot, in addition to allowing faceting and many other complex features one could desire for their plot.  Having a grammar and knowing how to employ it helps the user be able to customize their graphs and make them more readable. Once you know what graphic you would like to display with your data, it is easy to use the layered grammar to built that plot. 

Its incredibly useful that the grammar of ggplot and like packages can make manipulating certain aspects of plots easier. However, as mentioned in the article it does occationally make the code more verbose, which can be frustrating. Before reading this article, though I was familiar with building plots in ggplot and ggplot2 I had never heard of the concept of a "grammer of graphics". I'd like to learn more about how this terminology and idea came about. It would be interesting and benifical to read some of the background atricles referenced in the abstract and introduction of the article to find out more about this concept.
