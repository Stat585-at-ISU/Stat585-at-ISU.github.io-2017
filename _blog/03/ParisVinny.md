   Well the most obvious benefit I can think of is the organization of it. I mean base R coding is so messy and with so many commands on top of itself (which is kind of the feeling that I got was Wilkinson's "Elements" maybe). 
I'm not sure how much more efficient ggplot2 is given the number of characters needed to do soemthing, but for being able to read the code ggplot wins by a mile. And I feel most of that rests on it's embrace of grammar in graphics. With simple ggplot code it is pretty easy to immediately grab what variables you are interested in, whats the general plot going to be (geom), and other characteristics (scales, facets, etc). So in that respect I think grammar is a huge benefit to creating charts. The code takes on this weird psudeo-annotions because the easy of reading it. 

Something that I have noticed personally in my programming is that I can work ggplot2 a lot more easily because the layered grammar structure lets me see what I need. Kind of like the split, apply, merge idea last blog, the grammar lets us break a complicated plot into small pieces that can be tinkered to perfection one at a time. I really like that about the applied use of grammar that I've seen; it really lets you break a graph down into small steps. As a side note i really liked the Napoleon's march that he did towards the beginning. I have never seen a graph like that be made before.
