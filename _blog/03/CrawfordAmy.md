*How does having a grammar help with creating charts?*

I think the biggest thing that having a grammer helps us do while creating graphics is to be flexible. When we use this *Layered Grammar* we aren't confined to a set of well known, named graphics to visualize our data with. Whatever we think is appropriate for the data, objective, and audience is what we can do, and we can do it with ease. Thinking of the syntax as a grammar allows us to build the plot like we would build a sentence. Each peice contributes in its own way and in the end it was only a handful of small decisions that we had to make, or problems to solve.

It allows us to sort of "think outside the box" when we make charts. Even the most well known graphics can be easily decomposed and manipulated using the *Layered Grammar*. In the paper, I enjoyed when Dr. Wickham wrote out the full syntax of the basic plots using the `layer()` function and worked from there to show the streamlined, short hand syntax. It helps to see each layer written out as a full "sentence" using the grammar. Then, it helps to think of each layer as it's own peice of the plot to be tweaked and polished instead of the entire graphic as one clunky peice that can be difficult to manipulate. Using *Layered Grammar* helps get my brain into gear to think about plotting in a more flexible and customizable way.
