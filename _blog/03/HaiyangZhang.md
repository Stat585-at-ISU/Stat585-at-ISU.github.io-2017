 **How does having a grammar help with creating charts?**
 
Just like language grammar to make sentence better, the graphical grammar here is the foundation for making good graphs in programming language. It is my first time learning that there exists grammar of graphs, and I am inpressed by how powerful it is. 

The grammar form a good structure of creating graphs. The layer( ) command makes all the layers combined soomthly. The article also introduced the embedded grammar. When we have layered grammar embedded within an existing programming language, we can get compound graphic which displays a lot infomation in a same graph at once. So I think grammar does help creating charts not only easier, but actually also more clear for people to understand.
