Grammar of languages provides a structure for using words to communicate. It is possible to convey a message without using correct grammar. However, grammar does help to make the message more easily understood and more eloquent. These same ideas are true for a grammar of graphics.

The elements that go into a graph allow for a huge amount of flexibility. Flexibility is nice, but it can lead to an overwhelming amount of options. The existence of a grammar provides structure for what is possible. This can aid graph creators in staying focused on graphs that convey information in a meaniningful way. However, having a grammar also allows graph makers to be more creative than simply making a standard graph. The graph maker can play around with components that make up a graph in the realm of what the grammar permits to obtain a graph that is specialized for the particular data being worked on. 

On the computation side of the issue, a grammar of graphs helps in the creation of computer software since there is a procedure that needs to be followed in order to create graphics. In turn, if the users of the graphics creating program know the correct grammar, it makes it easier for them to use the program. This is espcially true for beginniners. A grammar dictates what is correct and what is not correct (where in this sense "correct" may mean "good practice"). Having rules can help beginners to know what is possible and how to use a program to create the graph.
