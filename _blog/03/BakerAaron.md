####How does having a grammar help with creating charts?

Grammar is helpful in creating charts because by default, grammar implies that you are doing something not only logical, but also in a way that contains well understood and easy to understand method. There are many ways of saying the same thing within a language but doing so with the correct grammar ensures the rapid and easy digestion of your logical statement for others around you, and especially in the case of coding, also for yourself. 

By breaking out graphing into specific grammatical structures that the author _Hadley Wickham_ of the article describes, there is a detailed and meaningful control of precisely how the graph turns out. And quite a lot of grammatical clarifications and systems there are within graphing. When it comes to layers of information, position adjustment, geometric objects, transformations, data and mapping, are the authors grammatical construction within the article. 

In the end, having a grammar gives deeper control to the author of graphical output, straightforward logical control of the graphing process, and also, assuming the grammar is well understood within a certain community, creates easy to read and understand code for those who may be interested in the underlying code producing the results.
