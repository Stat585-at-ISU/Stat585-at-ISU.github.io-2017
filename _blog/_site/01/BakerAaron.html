<h2 id="literate-programming">Literate Programming</h2>

<p>I have never heard of the term or idea of ‘literate programming’ until watching the video regarding the topic by Donald Knuth. The idea seems intuitinve and extremely worthwhile.</p>

<p>Previously, I have written many sets of long extended code that were relatively well documented, with information regarding what each function does. In one instance for an internship, that code was several thousand lines long.</p>

<p>Even with some annotation, having to go back through that code to potentially debug it after not seeing it for two years would be a very annoying and time costly project due to the ways the script interacts with itself and depends on a series of multiple functions working together.</p>

<p>Anyone else looking at that code would be utterly lost, and rightfully so. This adds unecessary mystery and confusion to the code, and even casts doubt on its veracity and operation because it is nigh impossible for anyone to verify that it was written to do what it is supposed to properly.</p>

<p>I can see the power and importance of literate programming and why it is a powerful concept for collaboration, clear programming, and debugging to name a few. I hope I can apply the concepts and ideas behind literate programming for my own personal benefit but also for the benfit of all who I work with in the future.</p>
