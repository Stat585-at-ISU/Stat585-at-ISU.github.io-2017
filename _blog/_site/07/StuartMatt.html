<h2 id="background">Background:</h2>

<p>The retracted Science paper <code class="highlighter-rouge">When contact changes minds</code> and the surrounding problems are discussed in detail in form of a  <a href="https://www.unh.edu/research/sites/www.unh.edu.research/files/docs/RIS/lacour_case.pdf">case study</a> on Responsible Conduct of Research by the Research Office of the University of New Hampshire. Read through the case study (and maybe try to find out some more of the details on the case).</p>

<h2 id="what-data-management-issues-does-this-case-raise">What data management issues does this case raise?:</h2>

<p>The first main issue is that how to determine that the data from the study is authentic.  As pointed out in the case study, LaCour simply took a CCAP raw data set, manipulated it, and presented it as his own.  After further reading “The Case of the Amazing Gay-Marriage Data: How a Graduate Student Reluctantly Uncovered a Huge Scientific Fraud” in <em>New York Magazine</em>, it seems as though the raw data that Broockman was given from LaCour’s study was too organized without the statistical anomalies one would expect from a large raw dataset such as this.  While that doesn’t necessarily indicate fraudulent activity, it does warrant further investigation.  Also, as pointed out in the <em>New York Magazine</em> article, the survey measured the subject’s feelings toward gay people on a 101-point “feelings thermometer”, and a previous analysis done on the data showed that “The noise is weirdly normally distributed with <strong>NOT ONE</strong> respondent out of 10,597 deviating by more than 25 in a negative direction or 38 in a positive direction.”  Obviously, data that represents a normal distribution is unusual and warrants more investigation as well.</p>

<p>Finally, as mentioned in the case study, LaCour ended up deleting the raw data with his explanation being that he deleted the raw data to follow university guidelines.  Of course, deleting a person’s identifying information is proper handling of raw data, but it is not proper to delete the entire data set in case someone in the department wants to use it for future research or if someone outside the department wants to replicate the study or use it in another way, such as Broockman.  This method suggests that either the person running the study is ignorant, or that something fraudulent is going on and the conductor of the study wants to delete the evidence.  This raises a major issue that raw data should be maintained for the cases of future endeavors; otherwise, this may suggest the data is improperly obtained.</p>
