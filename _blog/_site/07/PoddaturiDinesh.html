<p>As mentioned in the case LaCour’s raw data appeared to be too orderly and clean, which is highly impossible. For example, in one of our labs, we analyzed excel sheets (less than 150kb size), those files were not tidy at all. LaCour lied about his funding resources, the firm he hired to conduct the survey and deleted the raw data claiming that he wanted to protect the identity of study participants. As mentioned in the case UCLA allegedly requires deleting the identity of a person, but not all the raw data. In my opinion deleting raw data in a research like this gives us a red flag that there is something wrong with the findings of the research or the study itself.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-takeaways-from-this-case-are-">The main takeaways from this case are :</h2>

<p>•	Never lie about raw data or delete or modify the raw data to get predicted results.</p>

<p>•	Conduct the study ethically, obtain approval from the IRB to conduct the study.</p>

<p>•	Replicate the study and check if the results match with the initial data.</p>

<p>•	Make sure the authors involved in the research analyzed the data at least once.</p>

<p>•	Always think about the consequences of the study, how the outcomes might affect the society (sometimes peoples’ lives might depend on the outcomes, especially in <em>medicine</em>).</p>
