Discussion Question 10.

After the publication of LaCour's article and the backlash that followed, there were a lot of consequences for many different people. LaCour, in particular, faced many setbacks to his career from the publication of the false study.  As a result of this incident, LaCour had a faculty job offer at Princeton University rescinded. It must have been a great honor to be offered a position at such a prestigious university. To have an offer like that taken away, must have been terribly disappointing for LaCour.  Also, because of the dishonesty in his study and results, his resume was looked into further. It was found that he had some false information there as well. All of this will absolutely hinder his career trajectory. It seems like it might be impossible for him to get a job in academia after all of this is over with.  

LaCour is not the only one whose life was affected by these actions. Broockman and Kalla also must have faced consequences. The consequences for them seem to be more positive than they were for LaCour, since they played by the rules of research.  But imagine their surprise upon discovering all of this falsified data and study information. I imagine it must have been an interesting and intimidating introduction to the field of research, and all that can go wrong in it if rules of studies are not followed. Making the decision to call out LaCour on the missteps in the research must have been a difficult one to make. It sounds like their paper on prejudice and transgendered people was a more successful research endeavor. 

Dr. Green who was a co-author on the paper, and a prominent political scientist, might have also lost some of his prestige due to this mishap.  Since he did the data analysis on the project and did not verify the original data sources, he is somewhat responsible for some of the outcome of the publication going through. From his statement it sounded like he had a lot of regrets about taking part in the research. 

Other researchers in this field might also be affected by this publication because potentially their studies are put through more rigorous testing and reviews to make sure they are reproducible.  ULCA, also had its name on this publication because LaCour was a graduate student there when the research was conducted, which isn't good for their reputation.  Activists also suffered, as they had rethought their plans on informing people from the results of this study.  Since, the study was proven less than accurate, they have to once again come up with a new way of getting people interested in their ideas.
