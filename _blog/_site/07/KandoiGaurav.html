<p>I always wondered why someone would put in efforts in reviewing even though they are not duly compensated for it. Reviewers are regular people just like us, Faculty, Post-Docs, and Graduate Students. And there is little that can be done to completely prevent bias from the peer-review process. The reviewers are usually more interested in making sure that there are no apparent errors in the proposed methodology, results and the manuscript write-up. Having reviewed manuscripts myself, I would like to believe that most reviewers don’t even look at the data from which the results and conclusions are drawn. This stems from a lot of inherent factors like, trust and belief in fellow researchers.</p>

<p>Reviewers usually don’t try to replicate the findings of a study unless they see an obvious mistake. However, in LaCour’s case, the problem was not with the methodology or the interpretation, but with the data itself. If we assume that <em>Science</em> had amazing reviewers, given the data, they would have probably reached the same observations after trying to replicate the study. The reviewers couldn’t have done more after trying to replicate the analyses based on the presented data. The problem in LaCour’s case was the fact that the data itself was falsified. Even if we allow ourselves to believe that the reviewers went through all the pain to replicate the study, the current peer-review system isn’t built to check every nitty-gritty details of a study.</p>

<p>Reading through the case study, I feel that it took a lot of work for David Broockman and Joshua Kalla to uncover the falsification of data by LaCour. I see no way in which the current peer-review system would have found all these anomalies. It becomes more difficult when the system asks for very time-constraint peer-reviews. Another important point being that, the peer-reviewers are usually experts in the field of study but not necessarily statisticians.</p>
