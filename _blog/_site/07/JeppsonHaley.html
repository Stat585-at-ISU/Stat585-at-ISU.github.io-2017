<h3 id="background">Background:</h3>

<p>The retracted Science paper <code class="highlighter-rouge">When contact changes minds</code> and the surrounding problems are discussed in detail in form of a  <a href="https://www.unh.edu/research/sites/www.unh.edu.research/files/docs/RIS/lacour_case.pdf">case study</a> on Responsible Conduct of Research by the Research Office of the University of New Hampshire. Read through the case study (and maybe try to find out some more of the details on the case).</p>

<p>At the end of the case study, several questions are raised. Pick one of the questions and write a blog post discussing it. Make sure to state which question you are answering.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-think-lacour-was-able-to-publish-falsified-data-in-such-a-prestigious-journal-as-science">How do you think LaCour was able to publish falsified data in such a prestigious journal as Science?</h3>

<p>I think there are three primary reasons <code class="highlighter-rouge">When contact changes minds</code> was able to be published in Science.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There is an understood desire for novelty. Researchers are pushed to work towards new discoveries, not to confirm results that have already been published. The same can be said for journals - journals obviously want to be the first one to publish ground breaking results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having a well-known and prestigous co-author like Green likely allowed the paper to slide through the publishing process easier than it would have otherwise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of <code class="highlighter-rouge">When contact changes minds</code> speak to our better nature. That is, who doesnâ€™t want to believe that you can have a reasonable conversation with someone and that person may be inspired to follow your line of thinking?</p>
  </li>
