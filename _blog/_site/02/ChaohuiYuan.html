    <p><strong>Which (base R) functions do you know that support the split-apply-combine strategy? In your opinion, are these sufficient - state why or why not?</strong>. 
In base R, if it’s data frame object, to split it by particular column(s), I usually select it by column names. But this is not tidious since I have to type the data frame name every time when I try to call a particular column. This would make the code much longer. Another function that would select part of a data frame would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">subset</code>, but this still have to requre type the data frame name every time, which is not efficient.  There are some functions in base R that are kind of playing the role of <code class="highlighter-rouge">apply</code>, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">lapply</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">sapply</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tapply</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">rowMeans</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">rowSums</code> and so on. Those functions can be widely applied to vector, matrix and data frame, which is handy. Also as far as know, by using those function would make the R computing more efficient than <code class="highlighter-rouge">for-loop</code>.  To combine data frame or matrix, <code class="highlighter-rouge">rbind</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">cbind</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">merge</code> are the most frequently base R functions that I most use.  So there do exists some base R functions that could accomplish <strong>split</strong>, <strong>apply</strong> and <strong>combine</strong> well. But the problem is that they kind of accomplish it seperately rather then put them together. When we are pre-processing any data set, it’s common to use all of them. It would be super nice if could do this in a nicer and efficient way, in terms of removing duplicated typing and hopefully have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">piping</code> characterisitcs. Thanks to <code class="highlighter-rouge">dplyr</code> package, it makes this kind of job much easier than only relyed on base R functions. But there is still some disadvantages only use <code class="highlighter-rouge">dplyr</code> to clean up the data set, for example it’s not that easy to switch between wide-format and long-format for a data set in <code class="highlighter-rouge">dplyr</code>.

    <p><strong>Using a dataset of your choice, describe how you can use the split-apply-combine strategy for a part of the data analysis.</strong>
I usually use <code class="highlighter-rouge">dplyr</code> to clean data, add new columns/features into data set, or do some simple summary about the data by using <code class="highlighter-rouge">group_by</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">summarise</code>.</p>
