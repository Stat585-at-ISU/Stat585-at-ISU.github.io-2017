<p>The basic one that I can think of is the sort() function in R. I took an algorithm class from computer science department this past summer. We learned that most sorting or ordering function in Excel or SQL or others are using Merge-Sort idea which is also one of the split-apply-combine strategies. For example, when we sort, let say “statistics” alphabetically, the system technically keeps breaking down the words (array) in to half length until granular level like a tree. Then at the lowest level the system orders and combines and move back up.</p>

<p>This process is way more efficient than creating loop to compare first character to the rest of the characters etc.</p>

<p>We can use AirPassengers dataset here. We can remove the seasonality trend from time series using split-apply-combine strategy. I will plot the raw graph and identify if there is a seasonal trend, maybe every 12 months. Then I can split the data by 12 months and take average of each 12 months and combine them and look at the average trend.</p>
