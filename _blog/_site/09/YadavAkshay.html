<h3 id="the-mit-license">The “MIT License”:</h3>
<p>I would prefer to release my R package under <code class="highlighter-rouge">MIT license</code>. The main advantage of <code class="highlighter-rouge">MIT license</code> over other popular licenses like <code class="highlighter-rouge">GNU General Public License v3(GPL-3)</code> is  that you do not have to include the original version of the package (if any) or do not have to provide the detailed installation instructions for all the operating systems. Also under <code class="highlighter-rouge">MIT license</code> I cannot be held liable for any data loss or any hardware damage that occurs due to my R code. The main disadvantage of <code class="highlighter-rouge">MIT license</code> is that it cannot be used for patent claims.</p>

<p>Under <code class="highlighter-rouge">MIT license</code>, a software company can use my R package for their commercial product. They can also modify and distribute it or can sublicense it. As mentioned earlier, if the commercial product is damaged or doesn’t work due to my code from the R package, the company cannot hold me liable and sue me damages.</p>
