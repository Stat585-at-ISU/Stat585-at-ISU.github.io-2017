<p><strong>How does having a grammar help with creating charts?</strong></p>

<p>Grammar helps with creating charts the same way the split-apply-combine strategy helps with data analysis. It “brings together” things that would otherwise seem unrelated. Charts and graphs that would normally seem unrelated at first glance, because of obvious differences, are actually quite similar in “grammar”. Specifically with <em>ggplot</em>, I have seen how a histogram can be broken down in a similar way as a scatterplot. Having a grammar makes creating a graphic more intuitive as well as makes the code easier to read. This is yet another so-called short cut to use while thinking about a statistical problem and coding it in R.</p>
