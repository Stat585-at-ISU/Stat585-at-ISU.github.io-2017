<h2 id="a-grammar-of-graphics">A Grammar of Graphics</h2>

<p>As someone who was a little bit overwhelmed when trying to produce graphs in base-R, I look forward to having a defined grammar to follow that
will provide some structure to the graphic making proccess.</p>

<p>Decomposing graphics into smaller, easier to understand grammatical components that fit together as a whole make the 
process of creating high-quality graphics more accessible to inexperienced programmers. By providing a high-level structure to graphics,
complex charts become easier to build, understand, and reproduce. Following a grammar presumably also leads to more consistency in terms of
the quality of the end result.</p>
