<h2 id="what-are-intervals-durations-periods-and-instants">What are intervals, durations, periods, and instants?</h2>

<p><em>Instants</em> represent a point in time, whereas intervals, durations, and periods all represent spans of time. <em>Intervals</em> represent a span of time with a specific beginning instant and a specific end instant. <em>Durations</em> are precise spans of time without specified beginnings or ends; they are recorded in lengths of seconds so as to be invariant to weird idiosyncrasies of our calendar, such as leap years/seconds and daylight savings time. <em>Periods</em> represent spans of time that only have exactly known lengths (in seconds) once they are assigned a specific beginning and/or end point so that the previously mentioned idiosyncrasies of our calendar can be taken into account.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-these-distinctions">(Why) do we need these distinctions?</h2>

<p>These distinctions are particularly useful when the data and/or question(s) of interest involve measurement or consideration of time. Without these terms and their distinctions, what someone intends when they reference a unit of time may or may not be clear.</p>
