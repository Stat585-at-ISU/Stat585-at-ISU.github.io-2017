In his 1995 paper *WaveLab and Reproducible Research* David L Donoho pointed out the importance of "really reproducible" research, i.e. not only let the figures in the articles available to other readers and researchers but also make the complete software environment and the algorithms beneath the figures and resluts transparent and open worldwide, so other reseachers can reproduce the figures in their published articles, and to redo those figures with variations in the parameters. 15 years later, Donoho's new article *15 Years of Reproducible Research in Computational Harmonic Analysis* reveal the crisis of a growing credibility gap: "it is impossible to believe most of the computational results shown in conferences and papers." As a reseacher, we are all resiponsible to systematically and routinely ensure validity of results and make computational science more reliable. He also showed that as the reproducibility concept has been adopted by more and more people, the `WaveLab` package was highly cited and widely used in the past few years. The formalization of reproducible research needs the support from funding agencies and journals to speed up the adoption of reproducibility.


I can not agree no more with his idea of integrating reproducibility into scientific publication, because reproducibility makes a published article convincing. And thanks to the development of massive computation and the literature programming, we can more much easily combine the algorithms and codes with the analysis resluts. Rmarkdown allows the readers to reproduce or change some parameters in the code, and analysts can also share their code or package worldwide via Github.
