#### Based on these two papers, write a blog post discussing the commonalities and changes in the themes and solutions.

While both papers discuss the importance of reproducible research, they seem to have very different tones and attempt to tackle separate issues. *Wavelab and Reproducible Research* appears to be more focused on the sharing of results while *15 Years of Reproducible Research* seems more focused on being able to test the validity of results.

In the 1995 paper, *Wavelab and Reproducible Research*, reproducible research is proposed as a better method of collaborating and as a way more effective way to communicate results. The paper discusses problems they are currently facing - reproducing graphs with the correct parameters, effectively communicating results as well as difficulties, and reducing sloppiness and self-delusion. It proposes reproducible research as a way to create results that are universal and transparent.

Written 15 years later, the second paper goes beyond proposing reproducible research as a way to strengthen any results, and proposes that reproducible research is absolutely necessary for the maturation of computational science. Current practices of scientific computation are described as immature and error-prone. While many results have been generated, *15 Years of Reproducible Research* claims that many of these results lack credibility. 

The overall goal of both papers is the same. By promoting reproducible research, we can impose a discipline that will strengthen several facets of research, including the validity and communication of results.
