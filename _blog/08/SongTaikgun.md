The two papers both covers about reproducible research, however, with different focus.

The paper from 1995 talks about duplication of a study in terms of computer programming. That is, the original author of the research or someone else working independently should be able to reproduce the same output generated from the previous work. For example, if a figure generated by a computer code is attached in an article, the author should provide complete software environment, code, parameter used, and etc. of which the figure is generated. A few solution to achieve such reproducible research is to provide software packages (CD-ROM back in the day) or code written on quantitative programming environments.  Having access to these tools via internet or as freeware allow others to reproduce same computational output.

The second paper changed its theme to credibility. Although, the technological advance in the field of computer science was remarkable during the last 1.5 decade, the paper questions reliability of the knowledge generated by computational results. There could be many different types of errors that human make, however, the paper claims that the ubiquity of error created by computational science is underestimated.  Therefore, scientists and researchers should put effort to identify and "root out" errors in their computational output.
