In Donoho's 1995 paper, the authors focused the importance of reproducibility by 
clearly describing the Wavelab tool, stating each distribution , giving detail examples 
and basically tried  it make as possible as they could to allow others to 
reproduce all figures or tables in 
the published paper. He meantioned that Jon Claerbout, a geophysicist at Stanford, raised 
the concept of **really reproducible research in the Computational Sciences**.  
One thing that the author mentioned at the end of the paper **reproducibility is integrated into process**, for example the journals are full electronic and allow readers to go deeper 
into particular figures/tables by looking at the source code if they were interested in. 


In 2008's paper, Donoho revisited the idea of reproducibility. As he pointed out that 
reproducibility is more likely to leads to a better work in research since ** if everyone in a research team knows that everything they do is going to someday be published for reproducibility, they will behave differently and will do better work.**.  During the 15 years, Wavelab tool 
has been extended by several graduent students, professors, and extended to several other 
tools. Rather then just publish package, software publishing is also one new type of 
reproducibility. In that sense, it's unevitable that author is responsible for user feedback, 
code maintance (like wavelab for over 15 years), developing easy for use interfance (like the extension tool SparseLab and BeamLab),  developing simple demos which illustrate basic features and so on. 


Nowadayes, more and more people are taking the reproducible work seriously. 
Also as the author mentioned in the 2008's paper **development
of reproducible computational research skills is a fundamental part of graduate education and
postdoctoral education**. I can't agree with this any more.  Reproducibility is defenitely useful during my research experience  since often I have to go back to check what I've done after several months, even year. This reproducible stucture helps me 
a lot.
