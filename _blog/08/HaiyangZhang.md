## Based on these two papers, write a blog post discussing the commonalities and changes in the themes and solutions.

The themes of these two papers are very similar, which are both about reproducible research. Compare to the 1995 paper by Donoho, he didn't really change the theme but he did shift the emphasis from talking about how to reproduce research effectivaly and how to share codes and data among collebrators, to concern more about the crisis of credibility in reproducible research. The key element caused the shift is the improved technologies nowadays. In 1995, Donoho worried the most about the difficulty of reproducing research due to different parameter notations. Also, when I looked at the section 6 in his 1995 paper, all his future outlooks come true today, for example, people can click on the graph and then see the code or a new window with original data. With this technologies, people can make and catch errors easier. The solution he mentioned is about computational tool, like MatLab, Wavelab and SphereLab. With the fifteen years experiences with MatLab-based framework, Donoho feels reproducibility in computational science is possible and is important.
