In both the papers the researchers discuss about WaveLab- Reproducible Research via the Internet. WaveLab is a library in MATLAB, developed, designed and released by researcher’s around 1995 and the paper was published in the year 1995. This was primarily developed to reproduce all the figures that were published in wavelet articles. This package has varied tools for wavelet and time-frequency transforms. This tool allows all the other researchers to reproduce the images, tables that are published. 

In the paper “WaveLab and Reproducible Research”, researchers gave many examples of consequences for not having a mechanism for reproducing the research. One of the solutions for this problem is to develop a platform/software/tool that will allow all the researchers to compile their research and publish it on the internet. By this way the research in available for everyone to download and reproduce it with some tweaks. Since most of the researchers use a quantitative programming environment such as MATLAB, R, MATHEMATICA etcetera, developing a tool that works in these environments will benefit, the researchers to publish and the others to reproduce it. In this paper the authors gave many examples to generate and publish the reproducible research. The main focus was on the tool WaveLab and how we can make use of this tool for future uses. The WaveLab contains directories such as Datasets (to save the data like images or signals or raw datasets), Documentation (to save the summary of the contents of individual directories, functions and help for them). 

In the paper “15 Years of reproducible Research in Computational Harmonic Analysis - 2008”, the authors gave a brief information about how the advancement of technology helped researchers to conduct the study and make it available for others to reproduce it. In this paper the researchers introduced additional tools that are related to WaveLab, they are Atomizer, BeamLab, SymmLab, SparseLab, SphereLab. Each of these tools has their unique functionality to do analysis using different algorithms. Most of these tool boxes have similar features with Directories (to organize papers, Algorithms, Examples), Datasets, Documentation, Boilerplate (to explain the copyright policy), User Interfaces (a point-and-click window interface), and Installation. This paper clearly illustrates each tool box with an example. 

In conclusion, developing tools that works on the most of the quantitative programming environment helps the researchers to download and reproduce it. A good example for this is the packages available for “R” on the internet. Since R is an open source, one can download a package, use it for their research or add some extra features to it, which is later available on the internet for everyone else to download. By this way researchers not only benefiting themselves, but also helping fellow researchers.
