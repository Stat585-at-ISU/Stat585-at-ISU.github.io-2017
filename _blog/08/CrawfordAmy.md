There are many notable changes in themes between these two publications, but I will focus here on the theme of credibility. In his 1995 paper, David L Donoho doesn't worry much about the credibility of the work being published. When he speaks of reproducibility he is concerned more with the notion that researchers should plan their research so that it may be reproduced by someone else in the future. He urges researchers to not just publish the plots that look the nicest, but the plots that use the parameters discussed in the paper. He focuses on the idea that although a graph is the item of interest, the image itself is not a research deliverable. He doesn't seems concerned at all with the validity of the graph or its construction. He offers the solution of making complete software and source code available.

In his paper 15 years later, Donoho is very focused on the theme of credibility. In particular, he is worried that with the computational power that lies at our fingertips we are running around executing simulations and producing output and graphics that simply aren't supported by the theory and controlled experimentation that it should be. Since computation is highly error prone, the author is now urging researchers to spend time carefully crafting their code so that a perfect stranger could reproduce the results, not solely to dispel confusion, but because errors can creep in at any time. He declares that with this third branch of scientific methodology (computation) rapidly expanding, even the most seasoned of researchers can become less concerned with the *ubiquity of error* and produce far less *mature* results. The mature scientist has learned to discipline their thoughts and root out error and Donoho seems to be very pained by the fact that when presenting research we have come to give a simple "sales pitch" instead of focusing on the maturity of the researcher, the support that lends to our research, and the way that we sought out and fixed errors on the way to the result. He reminds us that in this day and age we are all fighting the battle against error.
