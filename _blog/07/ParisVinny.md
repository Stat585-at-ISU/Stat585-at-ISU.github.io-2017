What are some of the consequences of LaCourâ€™s behavior? For Broockman and Kalla? For Green? For other researchers in
this field? For UCLA? For activists?

Let's start with LaCour' immediate consequnce. He will probably never teach or do research again. His name has a terrible black mark on it (and well deserved) that will be hard for anyone to look over. I suspect even outside academia his career prospects are dim. I'm not sorry for him.

For Broockman and Kalla ultimately it was probably a good thing if I may be extremely pragmatic. There name must have became well known becuase of this incident. Broockman is now at Standford which is a cushy job I bet. That being said it must have been nerve racking to do what they did. Formally accuse someone of falisfying data cannot be an easy decision. It was probably right that the first thing they did was contact one of the authors when they started to get mounting evidence. That being said I am sure they are dissapointed that the research they were hoping to do ended up being a bust. Their actions are 100% correct but it would probably be a dissapointment to try and study something only to realize it was all a lie. 

Green's credibility was probably hurt. Not terrible since it sounds like his issue was merely carelessness with reviewing the data. He made some excuse about IRB at a different insitution but a researcher with human subjects should know to look at the raw data. The laziness of not was his issue. That being said he did do excellent in sending out the retraction and apology. He admitted he messed up which is a good trait. Still, I suspect that anytime he tries to publish something it will be under severe scrutiny. To a lesser extent UCLA also lost some face and especially the feeling that the academic atmosphere they have is breeding this sort of behavior. That being said UCLA is a large university and something like this was bound to happen so I really don't think that too many poeple held the university responsible. 

Other researcher's in this feild got sent down a rabbit hole after this bogus study. They wasted quite a bit of time and energy looking into something that turns out had falisfied data and faked resutls. That's time and energy the field isn't getting back and with little to no returns for what they put in. 

Activists were the ones I think that were hurt the worst. These people were working so that 20% of homeless youth are LGBT, or the suicide attempts rate among the LGBT community for young adults and teens is 8x the national average, and 6x the national average for depression according to some studies. I'm sorry, I don't mean to bring in sad statistics but sending up a false flag that led to less effective cultural change is very damaging to some people. His results were generalized to political beliefs in general but I am certain that if his study was specifically about the effectiveness of a conversation in regards to gay marriage then the LGBT activists were probably pretty quick to implement it. This is honestly why I'm more inflamed; these are not small issues that he lied about. These are individuals that were thrown under the bus so he could make a name for himself built on deciet. I feel most sorry for this group. 

Moral: If someone lies they run the risk of getting caught which is obviously a negative for the individual. But most of these negative effects are not related to that persons career but to the feild they lied to and to the people whom the research was directed towards. You shouldn't do reseach if all you want is a name; do research because you love your feild, because you want to help people, because you think you can make a difference. Alright, rant over.
