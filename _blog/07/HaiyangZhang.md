## 9. This case features a long-distance collaboration between a faculty member and a graduate student. What issues does the case raise about collaborating with others?##

In this case study, Dr. Green was collaborating with LaCour with an article retracted from Sience because that LaCour fabricated the data. This unexpected issue affected the reputation of Dr. Green, so in order to avoid this happen on us, I want to talk about the issues raised in this case study and how should we prevent these issues when we collaborate with others (especially long-distance collaborating). 

Issues: 
1) Dr. Green didn't double check the raw data that LaCour claimed that he collected by himself. 
2) Dr. Green also didn't suspect the reason why LaCour didn't provide raw data to UCLA. 
3) Dr. Green didn't communicate with LaCour's advisor during the research.

My thought:

As expected, LaCour is not a honest researcher. He not only fabricated the data, but also lied about his CV. When we choose to collabrate with others, morality should always be put in front of ability. And if we don't know a person so well, we definitely should do some research about this person. And also, we need to keep tracking the process and not just listen to the statement of our collaborators. Finally, for long-distance collaborating, we need pay more attention on communication to avoid what happened on Dr. Green happening on us.
