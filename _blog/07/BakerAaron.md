### What are the human subjects issues raised by this case? Were human subjects harmed and if so, how?

This has huge human subject issues. Firstly, the results of this study were wide sweeping and very framework changing. 
Meaning, if it was accepted, it would be something that would have huge affects on the way we approach relationships and
people's perspectives. Having such a framework change based on false data and fake results is an
aggregious consideration. 

Further, since the study wasn't regulated, there is questions we will never have answered as to, precisely,
what occured and why it occured. The actual reactions (assuming there was a real study) are unkown and any ethical issues, 
therefore also unknown. 

What is known is that such sweeping conclusions being published by a respectable journal show that greater care is needed in 
the information and conclusions we allow ourselves to believe based on the assumption of one study, and the importance of
reproducibility and repetition in studies, especially in the psychological area.
better.
