## Question 6
This case features a long-distance collaboration between a faculty member and a graduate student. What issues does the case
raise about collaborating with others?

Collaborating with others in group projects is great. There is however some drawbacks of team project especially long-distance collaboration. Before begin any research, it is always important to find the right persons to be in the group if the group's intention is for long term research like LaCour case. When it comes to collaborating with other people, the individuals ethics is highly valued here. For long distance collaboration, a person can present any results he or she preferred with minimum monitoring. Even that person is brilliant, his ethics should be placed here. Like corporate world, we always do background checking prior to employment as we try to eliminate unethical events in corporate.

Same for collaborating with other, understanding a person personality is important. If it's long distance collaboration, we need to be more careful on each other works. Few minutes of video conferencing can get a job done but not a good quality work.
