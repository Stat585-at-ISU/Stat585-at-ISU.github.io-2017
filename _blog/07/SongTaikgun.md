11. What are some lessons learned from this case?

It is always surprising to hear that high-profile journal such as \textit{Science} could possibly publish paper with falsified data.  What startles me the most is that these incidents happen every so often (In fact, I personally know a case that is currently under investigation). So, how could these happen? I think it is because people trust scientific paper and have tendency to blindly believe the result when a data set, claimed to be collected following a proposal, is provided.  After reading the paper, I have a feeling that Dr. Green and the reviewer of \textit{Science} did not check the raw data provided by LaCour. A simple exploratory plots of the raw data might have drawn question about the data, not enough variability in such a large data set for example, just like Broockman and Kalla. I feel bad that LaCourâ€™s paper got published with fabricated data and the editor or even the co-author did not bother to double check.
