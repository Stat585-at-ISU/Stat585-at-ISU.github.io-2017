### 4. What data management issues does this case raise?

One of the major issues related to data management in this case study is how to protect the identities of the study participants.
A critical component of any fake data-driven study is an excuse for not having the raw data after the study is complete.
Lacour claimed that he was following UCLA guidelines in place to protect the identities of the study participants. Perhaps Lacour
was outright lying, or perhaps he saw a lack of clarity in the guidelines. Regardless, any guidelines should clearly direct researchers
to maintain data integrity if at all possible during the C process.

I think the above hints at the larger issue of data being treated as an unimportant means to an end in many studies. In addition to
being a safeguard against fake results, preserving the original dataset also has other benefits. Old datasets can help guide researchers
attempting to reproduce results and can also act as the starting point for altogether new research. Particularly in statistics, it's
possible to gain insights by applying new methods to data collected with a different purpose in mind, and the more data available the 
better.
