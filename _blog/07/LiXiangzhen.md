###11. What are some lessons learned from this case? 
1.	Every researcher should be professional. We should keep honest and avoid misconduct. Not only be rigorous by ourselves but also learn to identify authenticity of unreasonable data. 

2.	As co-author of the paper, even if they do not know technical detail of the survey. Try to gain some common sense to test the data, real raw data usually have its characteristics and it is not too difficult to identify. It is also really important for a co-author to know the source of funding. It is interesting that in the study of the paper, Dr. Green do not know if LaCour have the $1 million research funding or not. If he asked for copy of official proposal of the study in the beginning, he might had known the problem.

3.	As a researcher in the same field, we should have courage to challenge authoritative journal. 

4.	For research institute, it need to build a good approval system, especially for study related to human beings. The approval system should include if the study topic is inhuman, where does the funding come from, if there are any potential social problems when proceeding the study.
