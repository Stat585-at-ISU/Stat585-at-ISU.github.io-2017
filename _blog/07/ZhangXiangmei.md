#What are some lessons learned from this LaCour case?#

Scientific misconduct is a serious problem that will damage the reputation of all parties involved including authors, co-authors, researcher institutions, journals who published it and even the research subject. And a "feel-good" but false result will misleading other researchers as well as the public to make useless effort on a wrong direction.

From this case we can learn that media coverage or journal prestige is not an indicator of good science. The extraordinary results in LaCour's article were widely reported by the national media and which inspired activists to adjust their approach. But the reporters only saw the "good" part of the article and failed to detect the irregularity because most of them didn't recheck the results or contact any other experts in human subject. Another lesson is even publishing on the most prestigious journals such as Science does not essure the results are true. This is disappointing but we need to be a little skeptical about the results of a article when it is "too" good.
