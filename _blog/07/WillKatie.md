__How do you think LaCour was able to publish falsified data in such a prestigious journal as Science?__

It truly makes me angry that LaCour was able to publish falsified data in such a prestigious journal. I am not so much angry at the journal, but more so disappointed in a PhD candidate. I am not sure what went wrong to be honest, but I think there is a lack of "data checking" in the publishing process. I believe that there is a level of trust that journals have with their authors that was taken advantage of in this case. The journal most likely assumed to Dr. Donald Green, or someone else involved, would have checked the raw data. Looking back to when I was getting a paper published in undergrad, I am almost certain we didn't have to submit the data we were working with. I can see why this process is left out when a paper is submitted. But I also believe that it wasn't the journals job to go through LaCour's data. The editors of *Science* are more concerned about the paper itself and the conclusions that are being drawn. It would cost the journal so much money to hire data scientists or statisticians to look through the data of every paper submission with a fined toothed comb. That would be incredibly cumbersome. I don't even want to look through the 19 data sets my students are submitting for their Stat 104 projects (and those are tiny data sets). In the end, it amazes me that LaCour thought he could get away with his lie, even if *Science* didn't catch it. It gives me hope that their are more trustworthy scientists our there that will hold each other accountable.
