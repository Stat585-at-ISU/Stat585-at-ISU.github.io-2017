In the light of this video, write a blog post discussing the use of interactive graphics: how have you experienced interactive statistical graphics (and in which systems)? What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now? 

From daily life, I have experienced interactive graphics online. For example, we can check weather online easily and for some sites, we can see the temperature by simply put the mouse above the map. I started learning and creating interactive statistical graphics after taking this class. I learned how to write shiny app, and how to use ggplot, ggvis, and plotly to make the interactive graphs. I do believe interactive graphics has a bright future and will be used more and more with the development of technology.
