Watching the video by Dr. Tukey presents a state of awe and brings perspective to how far we have come in the name of 
interactive graphics. Working with higher dimensional data has been a historic point of interest, and visualization of 
such data is often a challenging. An insight into the data can be worth much more than the effort made to achieve it, 
and hence interactive graphics hold high importance. In the modern day there are many many tools availabale that 
achieve or help us interactively work with statistical data. Working with plotly, ggvis has given me a good insight of 
what can be achieved with this. They not only allow for a platform of exploring the data, by restricting or setting 
certain constraints but also lets us immediately see what it follows and helps us channelize out efforts more 
stringently and in the right direction when trying to make some inference. I consider all tasks and functionality  
that allow us to get a fundamental understanding of the data by letting us view it on a scale, graph or as contour and 
allowing us to retain or restrict information so as to get better understanding of any hypothesis before actually 
testing them through rigourous methods, as an integral part of interactive graphics. We have seen many such examples 
while working with plotly ggvis ggplot where we have either generated a map or a graph and interactively changed some 
categorical variable or some hierarchial level of the data and got a better understanding of it in return.
