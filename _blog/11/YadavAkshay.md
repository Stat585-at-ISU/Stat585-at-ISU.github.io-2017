Personally, I do not have a lot of experience of working with interactive graphics. Major part of my interactive graphics experience comes from working on the project for this course which was fun. It is interesting to learn about the preferences and focus of interactive graphics requirements in the PRIM-9 system in the 1970s. 

Today, in the age of big data, I think the main focus of interactive graphics is accomodating huge amounts of data and options to focus on specified sections of the data. The functionalities like dynamically changing scales on the plots according to the data in focus and navigating different parts of large plots are some of the big privileges offered by current interactive graphics programs. 

I am currently working on earthquake data for the project and the previously mentioned interactive graphics functions have helped me to plot and view the location of earthquakes on a global scale. I can also dynamically zoom-in on any part of the world to view the exact location of earthquakes without changing the code for the plot.
