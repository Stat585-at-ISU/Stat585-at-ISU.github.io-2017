#how have you experienced interactive statistical graphics (and in which systems)? What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now? 

Before taking this class, I am only familiar and ecperienced interactive statistical graphics with RShiny program. Now we have learnt about ggvis, plotly and crosstalk, they are also great ways to create an interactive statistical graphic.

The idea of interactive statistical graphics interests me very much because it allows the user to understand the data from many different aspects as they want. As Tuckey said in the video, the user may don't exactly know what they want, so interactive statistical graphics should include the operations to move about and find the interested subset data on the figure and show the details for some picked data points.
