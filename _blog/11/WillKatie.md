## Background:

I have experienced interactive statistical graphics more this past year than ever before.  The main reason being 2016 was a presidential election year.  I frequented sites like *FiveThirtyEight* and *The New York Times* to get up-to-date stats on the race. I found these sites to be extremely helpful and very easy to understand.  A lot of that had to do with the interactive graphics that they had created to display the information. I think that the main focus of graphics now is comprehensibility.  Because the internet is open to everyone (and not everyone has a statistical background) graphics must be easy to use, and more importantly easy to understand.  Interactive graphics, in my opinion, draws people to information as well. There are some really neat graphics out there that are fun to use and learn from.
