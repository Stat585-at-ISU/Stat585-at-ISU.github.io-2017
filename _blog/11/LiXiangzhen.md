###In the light of this video, write a blog post discussing the use of interactive graphics: how have you experienced interactive statistical graphics (and in which systems)? What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now? 


In this video, Dr. Turkey introduced the RRIM-9, interactive multi-dimensional data display and analysis system. It is a surprise that we already have a pretty helpful interactive data display system in 1970s. The system could let users view the data up to 9 dimensions. The users could rotate the data or view the projections of the data in any two-dimensional level. 

In my experience, the first time that I use the interactive statistical graphics is using JMP. When JMP is used to do regression analysis, we could choose many of types of regression distribution, or transfer type of variables. If we add Javascript code in the JMP, it could generate random samples. I also have interactive graphical experience in R. The package “plotly”and “ggvis” and shiny app are great tools to build interactive statistical graphs. Compared to 1970s, R could do much fancy work now. We could rotate or view the projection of data with much more than 9 dimensions. Group of points could be selected and zoomed in the interactive interface. The added slider or checkbox and many other widgets can be used to filter the range of variables. We could also change color, plot data by group or facet, show label of data points, and display animation along with time changing. The development of interactive statistical graphics is very important to statistical analysis. In the initial analysis, intuitive graphic could provide lots of information, such as outlier, trend, period etc. A good statistician should have cautiousness of displayed data, and advanced interactive statistical graphical tool is necessary support of the analysis.
