Most of my experience with interactive statistical graphics has been in the past few years. I’ve never written a program or app that can create an interactive graphic, so I’ve enjoyed learning how to make a shiny app or how to use plotly. I thought it was interesting to see how far we’ve come in interactive graphics since the 1970’s. Users have a lot more control over displays of a plot than users of the PRIM-9 system had. For example, it is easier to “point and click” to select what region of points you do or don’t want included in a plot. It is also easier to look at several plots (for example, using faceting in ggplot) at once to look for trends across more variables. The PRIM-9 system was advanced at the time, but it seems so out dated today. I wonder if students 50 years from now will watch videos about plotly, shiny, or ggplot and be amazed at how primitive our interactive graphics are.
