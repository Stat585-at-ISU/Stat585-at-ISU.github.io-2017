That was a cool video on prim 9. Personally, I heard of interactive graphics but did not try it out. The interactive graphics is really helpful expecially for visual learner. It also helpful for us as statistician to visualize the graphics especially when we are dealing with high dimensional model or data. Like it illustrated in the video, masking is really useful for interactive graphics. Sometimes, it's easy to perform high dimension computation and overlooked on the visualization. 

I think I kind of experiences the interactive graphics when I took calculus 3. We tried to plot a 3 dimensional on Matlab. Instead of using 4 buttons like PRIM 9, I used on button to click and drag to see the different section of the dimension. I think that's pretty cool. I would consider myself still an amateur in interactive statistical graphics. I would love to involve in the interactive statistical graphics group.
