### Interactive Graphics

In terms of producing graphics, my entire background is limited to the past 2 years here at Iowa State. I suppose in
some sense ggplot2 could be considered interactive (I imagine John Tukey would!), in that it is easy to manipulate colors, shapes,
groupings, etc., in the underlying script. But what I typically perceive as interactive is a graph that requires no code writing to change -
where input is received through clicks and embedded widgets, and the graph changes as the inputs change. To this end, I'd imagine
the ways interactive graphics can be implemented is limitless, and people will continue to create new ways to interact with 
data as data and technology changes. I imagine virtual reality and 3-d technologies may drastically change what we typically
think of as interactive graphics today, and I look forward to it!
