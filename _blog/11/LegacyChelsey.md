## Background:


In the light of this video, write a blog post discussing the use of interactive graphics: how have you experienced interactive statistical graphics (and in which systems)? What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now? 

Interactive statistical graphics are an area of interest to me. I hope to do further research in this area in the future. Currently, I have only limited experience with Shiny, ggvis, plotly, and other random java or html based interactive graphics that I have come across looking for additional materials to show while I teach 101. 

I think we have, obviously, come a bit further in interactive graphics since the creation of this video. We have the ability in some programs to rotate the axis like they do in the video, we also have other controls over the plot that was not available then. We have more control over colors, axis, point shapes, and being able to manipulate these things on screen quickly and easily. Some programs allow the user to move points by pointing and clicking, or even add and delete points from a graph. There is much more interactivity available now than there used to be, but this is still an area that could be expanded upon as technological advances keep being made.
