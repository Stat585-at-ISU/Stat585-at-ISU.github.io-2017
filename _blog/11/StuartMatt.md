## Interactive Statistical Graphics

Aside from what we have discussed in this class, I really have no experience with interactive graphics.  I have only used applications such as Plotly, GGVis, and the Shiny app in what we have done in class, with our labs, and in my final project as well.  However, I have realized that these tools are very useful in many statistics applications.  It makes data easier to read and manipulate for both non-statisticians on the project as well as people who are not privy to the project to create their own analyses.

In terms of the PRISM-9 system, I was actually fairly surprised that even the small capability of rotating data was available in the 1970s.  Obviously more advanced systems have been created since then, but rotation does show new, interesting, and possibly important details of data that otherwise was not available prior to then.  Graphics definitely have been ingrained as an important part of statistics over the years since the debut of PRISM-9, and I know I will use more interactive graphics in terms of my research going forward.
