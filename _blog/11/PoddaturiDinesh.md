We all know the old English idiom “A picture is worth a thousand words”, in our context (Interactive graphics) I think we all agree that “An interactive graph is worth 50 tables, or at least 10 tables”.

In the video, Tukey introduced PRISM-9 system that can do picturing, rotation, isolation and masking. It’s very interesting how far the interactive graphics advanced compared to the video where Tukey used the keyboard to manipulate graphs. Now, by writing some code or with clicks we can change many aspects of a graph. 

I have experienced interactive graphics in this past few years, especially in this semester. I have learned how to make interactive graphics using ggplot, plotly, ggvis and Shiny. In fact, my project for this course has interactive graphs in it. It’s really fascinating how we can transform real world data into an interactive graph which speaks for itself. As technology advances we need more sophisticated ways to build an interactive graph that is easy to write and maintain.
