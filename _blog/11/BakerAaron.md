## Background:


In the light of this video, write a blog post discussing the use of interactive graphics: how have you experienced interactive statistical graphics (and in which systems)? What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now? 


The only type of interactive graphics I have experienced have been from a third point of view. To be specific, I have experienced them in the graphics group by presentation by a few of our esteemed students given examples of packages overlaid on ggplot2 that could be used to drill down into more detail, separate data, and quickly scroll through long time series and compare sections of time sereies alongside each other. 

Honestly, I think that what he has talked about is extremely impressive, in that it hits the main points of what is important with modern graphics, from a very early perspective, in a very comphrehensive way. Simply put, the goal of grahpics, interactive or no, is that they summarize information appropriately, powerfully, and most importantly for interactive graphics, with ease of use. 

 think we have, obviously, come a bit further in interactive graphics since the creation of this video. We have the ability in some programs to rotate the axis like they do in the video, we also have other controls over the plot that was not available then. We have more control over colors, axis, point shapes, and being able to manipulate these things on screen quickly and easily. Some programs allow the user to move points by pointing and clicking, or even add and delete points from a graph. There is much more interactivity available now than there used to be, but this is still an area that could be expanded upon as technological advances keep being made.
