I've been exposed to interactive statistical graphics since last year, 
especially from Shiny. I found such interactive graphics is a super awesome  
tool to do visulization. Unlike static plot, interactive graphics allows the users 
to have more power and to explore more rather than just author convey his/her idea. 
It is a good to do communication, for example, user can zoom in a particular region of 
interest in `plotly` to explore more information. What's more, it's also another way to display 
high dimensional data in some sence. For example, thanks to the tool of `crosstalk`, it makes much 
easier to connect between spatial, tempo, and other basic static plots. I cannot imagine how to display 
such information only using static graphics in R. 
It also makes statistics much more interesting, and 
draw people's attention as well. It brings a lot of fun for playing around the interactive graphics, at least for me.
