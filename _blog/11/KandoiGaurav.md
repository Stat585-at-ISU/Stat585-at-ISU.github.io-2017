Interactive Graphics are amazing! I din't have any experience working or using interactive graphics before this class (though I had heard a few things about the java D3 libraries). In the age of *Big Data*, interactive graphics are essential. I can't imagine a meaningful way in which I can simply plot few million data points and get anything out of it. Interactive Statistical Graphics provides a platform to present meaningful summary statistics and even batches of data. Being able to communicate in real-time with the data through an interface allows a user to explore the data and learn from it. It is of much importance for people with limited knowledge of statistics or the data itself. My current experience with interactive graphics is limited to the use of *shiny*, *plotly*, *ggvis* and *d3* libraries.

When I think about interactive graphics, the first thing that comes to my mind are buttons. These buttons can be anything from rabio buttons to drop-down menu's to slider bars. For me, anything that gives me the power to manipulate data, choose the type of graph and manipulate the graph etc. is considered interactive graphics.
