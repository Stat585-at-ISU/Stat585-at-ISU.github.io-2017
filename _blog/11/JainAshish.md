In the light of this video, write a blog post discussing the use of interactive graphics: how have you experienced interactive statistical graphics (and in which systems)? What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now?

The video is quite interesting as the visualization ideas that was used for analyzing the dataset are still relevant. As demonstrated in the video, PRIM-9 was used to plot data in 2 dimensions and also there is options to rotation and axes change of the data. The way they used buttons to flip and rotate the data is somewhat similar to what we also do to analyze our data. But now it takes only one line of code to plot the 2D dataset compared to complicated code and bulky infrastructure earlier. Prior to this class, I have used various javascript frameworks to build interactive statistical graphics including Jquery, D3.js, and Chart.js. I have used these frameworks for data visualization in both industry and research. I have used these frameworks to build interactive plots and graphs in which users can change different parameters in order to analyze the data. During this class, I came to know about the shiny package for developing interactive graphs and I find it easier to work with than the frameworks I earlier used. I think anything which gives the user the freedom to make changes for the better understanding of the dataset is a part of interactive statistical graphics. The packages like `plotly`, `ggvis`, and `crosstalk` have made graphics more interactive.
