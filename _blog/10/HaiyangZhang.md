My first R package was created during lab 5 with 2 other classmates. Our package is a simple one that can help people calculate proportion easier, which can let you calculate proportions by the whole columns or rows. The hardest part is not writing the function itself, but how to make it go through and get proved by CRAN without errors and warnings. It is a little tricky about the suffix like "rda.". We used "Rda." firstly, but it failed going through the CRAN check process. We took a long time to figure this out, which should be a easy to fix problem. From this experience, I realized making R package is not as hard as what I thought, but I need pay more attention on details if I will continue making R package in the future.
