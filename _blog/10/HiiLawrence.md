This is my first time writing a r package with my group. In the beginning, maybe because I am new to github, we had some trouble is getting the package setup in github through `Rstudio`. Taek, a member of our group is experienced in it that solved the problem. Another problem is that we (Vinny and I) are also trying to figure if commit comes first or push first when we wanted to submit our work. Later, we splited up the work. And here is the cool part. Github works really well in group setting. We can split up the work and pull from the repo when we wanted to test our code. Another challenge we realized after we put everything together is the debugging process in order to pass the check() test. We also realized that the example that we used to test our package also located within the package. Overall, writing this package is a learning process. I can see that things get messier when we wanted to include more functions in the package.
