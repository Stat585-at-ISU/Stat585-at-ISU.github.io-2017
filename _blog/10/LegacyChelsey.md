## Background:

By now all of you have collected some experience in writing an R package. How did that go? What were the difficulties? Have you got a story to share about a CRAN submission that went particularly well (or not)?

Write a blog post on your experience. 

Writing the project for lab is the only experience I currently have writing an R package. The idea of writing an R package is still slightly daunting. But I feel like the simple package my group created for the lab did help me understand the process, which helped to make it slightly less intimidating. We ran into several tricky parts of putting together the package that we needed some guidance on. Specifically, we had trouble putting our new data set into the package. That was a part of the process that I didn't fully know how to do, and I am still working on understanding how all the files got put together. The roxygen comments made making the documentation process quite smooth once we figured out how to get them working.  The experience of making an R package seems like something that might take time and practice, but the introduction to it in lab definitely helped make the process seem less imtimidating. I do not have any CRAN submissions, but I would like to work more on making packages in the future now that I have begun to understand the progression of it.
