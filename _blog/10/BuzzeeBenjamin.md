By now all of you have collected some experience in writing an R package. How did that go? What were the difficulties? Have you got a story to share about a CRAN submission that went particularly well (or not)?


Going into lab 5 I had no experience writing R packages. One point of confusion for me was dealing with all the folders when intializing the package.
It was a bit difficult to understand which folders are necessary, which are good practice to create, and what pieces of code (or data) go where. 
Another topic of confusion that I am dealing with right now is how to take an existing package, modify the source code, and then use the new version in a program.
As of now I simply load the package and redefine the function of interest at the beginning of my script. I'm sure there is a way to load the modified
package straight into the R workspace. Overall, it may take me a lot of googling, but I'm fairly confident I could figure out the finer details of writing
an R package now that I've created a very one myself.
