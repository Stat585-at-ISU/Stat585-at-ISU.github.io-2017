## How did writing an R package go? What were the difficulties? Write a blog post on your experience.  

Working on an R package for my creative component and creating a small R package for the lab have been really good learning experiences for me. I definitely think there is a pretty big learning curve, but once you've worked through the struggles your first time creating an R package, it gets easier each time after that. I have yet to go through a CRAN check for that package or attempted to submit to CRAN, but even just going through the process of figuring out what files need to be in what locations and learning about the Roxygen comments was a fun challenge. I think the syntax of the Roxygen comments is fairly straightforward, but it is just new to get used to a file creating other files for you within the structure of the package. I also think it is interesting to not only have to develop things that work, but to figure out how those components will work with someone who is using the package. For my creative component, I have been using the shiny app I created inside a package, and using the package and app myself have helped me to find lots of issues that users would have run in to had I not tested it out on my own. It is a strange experience to think that other people will be interacting with the things you create, because I have never been a part of something like that before. I think the biggest issue is getting all of the necessary elements set up and not putting anything in the wrong place. It's very easy to mess it up if you aren't familiar with the framework needed for the entire package. All in all, I think it comes down to keeping all the little details straight and making sure you have the things that the users will see set up correctly.
