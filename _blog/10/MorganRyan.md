## Background:

By now all of you have collected some experience in writing an R package. How did that go? What were the difficulties? Have you got a story to share about a CRAN submission that went particularly well (or not)?

Write a blog post on your experience. 

## Post:

My only experience writing an R package was in lab 5, so I don’t have anything too unique in regards to difficulties writing a package. One thing that stood out to me when working on the package was how difficult it was to be detailed but concise when completing the documentation for the package. I’m confident the package my group wrote isn’t going to be installed and used by thousands of users anytime soon, so there wasn’t any pressure when writing the documentation for our package. This made me appreciate the detailed documentation that is available for packages that I’ve used. Another difficulty my group had was fixing the warnings and errors found by running devtools::check(). Fixing the warnings turned out to be an easy fix, but it took my group and I a while to find what it was that was giving our package problems. If it took us a while to fix the warnings for a package as simple as ours, I can imagine how tedious and difficult it can be to fix larger, more complicated R packages.
