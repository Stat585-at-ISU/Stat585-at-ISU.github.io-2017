#### Assume you are the author of a successful and popular R package. Which license would you pick? Write a blog post discussing some of the pros (and cons) of the license. Discuss what would happen if a software company wants to use the package as part of their code and sell a product. What happens if the code doesn't work as expected and a user tries to sue you?


***

For licensing my R package I chose the GNU General Public License version 3. Under this license, the author is able to freely distribute the package to all users either free of charge or for a fee. GPL-3 requires that the source code is made available and can be modified by any user that chooses to do so. Additionally, GPL-3 ensures that any software that incorporates code produced for this package must also be licenced under GPL therefore ensuring that the software must also be free and have the source code available. Under this license there is no warranty - if the code doesn't work as expected, a user would not be able to sue me.
