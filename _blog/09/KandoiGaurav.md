If I were to develop and distribute a R package, I would choose the licence depending on who the end users might be. If it were for academia, I would want more freedom for users in terms of code sharing and distribution. I would also prefer not being sued by a user who fails to acheive what the package was intended for. That being said, I think, atleast for now I'll settle with the GNU General Public License, Version 3.

The main essence of the GNU GPLv3 is providing freedom. I, as the author of the package will be able to either distribute the copies of my package for free or charge for it. If a software company wishes to use my package, modify it, and then sell it, they will be free to do so. However, unless there is a prior communication, the company will use my package "as is" without warranty. With this clause being applicable, even if the package doesn't work as expected, the company can't sue me.

A major advantage of this license is that, it preserve's the ability and right of users to see and build upon the original code while removing all personal liabilities. Being the author, I will have the right to modify the package. The users will also be able to modify and redistribute the modified version of the package, as long as the mdifications are not attributed to the original author.
