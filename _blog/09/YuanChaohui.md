## R Licenses
It might depend on the purpose of the package or who develop the package. For me, 
I would prefer to MIT License since it's short and simple with conditions only 
requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. There is template for MIT 
licenses which makes it easier to start with. It is free and has a lot of permission 
and few restriction. It allows user to both private and 
commercial user to modify, copy, use, distribute, publish and sell copies of the Software. 
But of course, there are also some disadvantage for this licenses,
two issues are limitation of liability and warranty, which means the the author has no responsibility 
if it's not working.  Basically it states that the user could do what you want with this software, except sue the author.  
But it might the case that some one integrate a software which is MIT license into their own product, 
and make it not open source.  But for the MIT license, the author doesn't sue the user and the user cannot sue the
author neither. The author doesn't care about credit. But for a company who tries to develp a package, it might be better 
to choose other type of licenses which contain patent, meaning that the developer has the source code right for this
software even with the derivitive work based on the software.
