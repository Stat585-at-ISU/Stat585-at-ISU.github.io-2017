## Background:

There are a lot of different licenses in R under which authors can make their packages available, see e.g. https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/. 

Assume you are the author of a successful and popular R package. Which license would you pick? Write a blog post discussing some of the pros (and cons) of the license. Discuss what would happen if a software company wants to use the package as part of their code and sell a product. What happens if the code doesn't work as expected and a user tries to sue you?



I would choose the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2 License if I am the author of a successful and popular R package. Couple reasons: first of, the souce code is open for all the users, and I think that goes well with the nature of R - a sharing and open source. Also, I have the full control of my package. I can share and modify the package for free or for a fee depends on situations. One of the cons is since it's a free software, there is no warranty on the product and I need to be responsible for any failures of the code in my package. 

If a software company wants to use the package as part of their code and sell a product, they need to make notice in the copyright and discalimer of warranty of my package. If the code does not work, from the licensing agreement section 4 and section 10, it seems since the program is not under any warranty, no author is repsonsible for any failures.
