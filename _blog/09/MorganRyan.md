If I was the author of a successful and popular R package, I think I would license the package under the “GNU General Public License” version 3 license. Under this license, I have the freedom to distribute copies of the software for free, or to charge for it if I wish. Section 4 says that I would be able to “charge any price or no price for each copy that I convey, and that I may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.” This license also requires source code to be available, which I think is a good thing. Providing the source code makes it clear what the program is doing, and also allows other people to use/modify the code. If someone (or a software company) were to modify or use the package as part of their code, they would be required to post their code under the same license. This license also explains that there is no warranty, so a user would be unable to sue me if the code doesn’t work as expected.
