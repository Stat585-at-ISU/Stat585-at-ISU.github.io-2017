##Write a blog post discussing some of the pros (and cons) of the license you selected. 

I opted to read through the [MIT license](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/MIT). This is probably the safest choice, without any consultation of someone more familiar with the legalese, which I don't really have the experience to sort through and understand at a level I'd be comfortable with.

The most obvious pro of this option is that it's straight forward: *do whatever you want with this code, and I'm not responsible for anything that goes wrong*.

The most obvious con for this option is that if someone uses the work you've done in some sort of commercial application or for a profit, *I have essentially relinquished any claim to credit for what goes right*. 

From my reading, my understanding is that by someone choosing to use the code, they accept the terms, which is that I, as the writer, can't be held liable for anything that happens, even in the unlikely scenario that it causes damage of some kind. Admittedly, it's hard to imagine what that damage could be, but it would seem better to be cautious and guard against that possibility. 

From what I can discern, it seems like the only thing required of anyone who does choose to use the code is that they also include a copy of the license that I've included with my original code.
 
Just for reference, I also looked at the TLDRLegal summaries for [GPL-2](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v2) and [GPL-3](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)). From those summaries, it seems like the biggest difference is that with the GPL licenses, there's a stricter expectation that the user(s) not directly sublicense the code, and also that they have disclose the original code, its source, and what modificaitons they made to it. GPL-3 also requires the inclusion of installation instructions.
