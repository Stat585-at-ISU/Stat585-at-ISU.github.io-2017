Assume you are the author of a successful and popular R package. Which license would you pick? 


I will probably choose GPL-3 license for my furture package. Because this license will maintain the open-resouce nature of the program and I as the developer can distribute and share with other people for free or charge some money if I wish. I can also change or edit any version of my program. Another benefit is other users an developers can use and modify the package, so they can contribute to the development of this package, and users can always get the latest version of the package for free. And the disclaimer of warranty in this lisence states that there is no warranty for the program. If some company want to use the package as part of their code and sell a product, they need to state the exclusion of warranty in a copyright and mention that this package is a free software, the developer is protected from lawsuits if the codes does not work as expected.
