Given a choice of Licenses, I would prefer to use the GNU General Public License Version 3. There are many benefits 
associated with it, with the major advantage being able to share or change the given code for free  or for charge as 
deemed appropriate by the company. This also frees the author of any obligation to be liable in case the code does not 
give the desired results to the user, and also allows the user to modify the code as long as the modified version is 
not attributed to the original author. This however, from a user stand point means no warranty and might not be the 
best suitable option for codes that are supposed to deliver high quality or error free results. The user in this case 
is responsible for ensuring if the code performs as per his / her objectives.

The MIT license is another great option as it again removes liability from the author, and is useful if I want to 
distribute my code or make it open source, but this does not accommodate for charging a price for the product. Another 
disadvantage is the potential of other users to change parts of the code and then sell it for their own profit. The 
GNU GPL Version 2 allows for free distribution but again puts the responsibility on the author of the code for 
maintaining it.
