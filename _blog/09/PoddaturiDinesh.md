If I am the author of a successful package I would choose GNU General Public License Version3. In general, any software licensed under the GPL has unrestricted access to all the code and how a user uses that software. A user/company can make multiple copies of the software or modify/add additional functionalities to the source code and sell/distribute the software as long as the derivate software is GNU GPL licensed. By licensing my package with GNU GPL version3 I am making the package as an open source. The programming community can add more functionalities to improve the quality of the package and I will have access to the added code. The license also mentions that the developer/owner of the software is not liable if a user doesn’t know how to use it. I would use MIT licensing, if I don’t want to face any kind of legal issues with my software.
