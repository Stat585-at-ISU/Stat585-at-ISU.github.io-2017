##Licenses in R

I would like to use the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (AGPL-3) for my R package. I believe the most important thing in carrying out research is freedom. By opting for AGPL-3, the program can be freely distributed and shared across the research community. This will also give freedom to other developers to improve the code by modifying the existing code. This will leads to a faster development of the code in terms of features which helps in improving it. In addition to that, this license makes the mandatory that the improved or modified program will become publically available for sharing and use by the community. This will greatly benefit the research community as they will get improved version of the program.
If a software company wants to use a part of the code in their product, they have to display a copyright notice and clearly mentioned to the user that there is no warranty for this code. In the license, it is clearly stated that under this license there is no warranty given for the program unless that is given in writing. This means that if the code doesn't work as expected, a user can't sue the person who developed the program.
