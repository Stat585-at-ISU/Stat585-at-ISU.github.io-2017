If I were the author of a successful and popular R package (like Hadley) I would choose the GNU General Public License, Version 3. This license would allow a software company to use my package, modify it if they wish, and sell it. As the author, the license also allows me to charge the company a fee, if I wish (unlike the MIT license). Unless I state otherwise, the company would use my package "as is" without warranty. So, if the package doesn't work as expected or is defective, the company cannot sue me. It would be the responsibility of the company to fix the package. However, it is my responsibility to clearly mark modified versions to prevent problems in the future. I would also feel more comfortable choosing this license because it goes into greater depth (than say the MIT license) on what is expected from me and what is expected from users. I would want to take comfort in knowing I had legal protection against things that could go wrong in my arrangement with the company buying/using my package.
