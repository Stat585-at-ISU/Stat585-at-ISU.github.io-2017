### The "MIT License":
I would prefer to release my R package under `MIT license`. The main advantage of `MIT license` over other popular licenses like `GNU General Public License v3(GPL-3)` is  that you do not have to include the original version of the package (if any) or do not have to provide the detailed installation instructions for all the operating systems. Also under `MIT license` I cannot be held liable for any data loss or any hardware damage that occurs due to my R code. The main disadvantage of `MIT license` is that it cannot be used for patent claims.

Under `MIT license`, a software company can use my R package for their commercial product. They can also modify and distribute it or can sublicense it. As mentioned earlier, if the commercial product is damaged or doesn't work due to my code from the R package, the company cannot hold me liable and sue me damages.
