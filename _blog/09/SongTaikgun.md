I would choose the GPL-3 license when it comes to writing a program. As an author of the R package with GPL-3 license, I will have the freedom to distribute the copies of the program and charge if I wish to. The users of the program will have access to the source code, and as a result, the program will be improved by the community that uses and modifies it. GPL-3 allows a company to use the program and sell the product, however, the company cannot deny access of the modified version of the program, .i.e., GPL-3 license will prevent Tivoization. Since there is no warranty for software under the GPL-3 license, therefore, I will not be liable for errors or damages caused by the program.
