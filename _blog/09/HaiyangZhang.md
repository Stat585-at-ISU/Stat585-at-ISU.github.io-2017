## Which license would you pick? Write a blog post discussing some of the pros (and cons) of the license. Discuss what would happen if a software company wants to use the package as part of their code and sell a product. What happens if the code doesn't work as expected and a user tries to sue you?

I would choose the MIT Licence. Although it cannot bring a lot of profit to the author, because it is free of charge and anyone can use, copy, modify, publish, sublicence, or even sell the copies of the package, there are still many pros, for example people can use and share the package freely without limitation. Also, the largest benefit of using the MIT Licence that I can think of as an author o fa R package is that I won't get any liability for writing the package. The MIT Licence won't have warranty of any kind, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability. It won't be hard to answer the next question about lawsuit. As an author with a MIT Licence, I won't need to worry about this problem.
