I will pick GPL-2 license for my package. There are a couple reason for this. One is that it's a free license. Part of this license is that the recipients can look at the source code. I believe this is the major advantage of the license. With this, my package will be more transparent instead of a black box for users. Another advantage is that I will have full ownership of my package unless I am willing to give it away. This license also reserves the originality of my source code. One of the cons is that the license does not protect me from consequences of the failure of the code if there is an error in my package. Also, I cannot control the distribution of my package since it will be make to public under this license.

When someone or some company would like to use my packge in their product and resell it, they need to put in the copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty of my package in their product. I also can charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and offer a warranty protection in exchange for a fee. The company has the right to sue if the code doesn't work as expected. But it can be case by case basis.
