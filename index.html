  <h4>Course description:</h4>
  <p>Not all data lives in nice, clean spreadsheets, not all data fits in a computer's main memory. As statisticians we cannot always rely on other people and sciences to get the data into formats that we can deal with: we will discuss aspects of statistical computing as they are relevant for data analysis. Read and work with data in different formats: flat files, databases, web technologies. Elements of literate programming help us with making our workflow transparent and analyses reproducible. We will discuss communication of results in form of R packages and interactive web applications.
  </p>

    <h4>Learn how to...</h4>
    <ul>
<li>read and combine data from flat files, SQL database, binary netCDF, and making use of web technologies as data source.</li>
<li>compute with data. </li>
<li>clean the data, check the quality, impute missing values.</li>
<li>write efficient and reproducible code so others are able to replicate the analysis.</li>
<li>develop software, individually and collaboratively, debug, profile and package R code.</li>
<li>experiment with event driven programming to build an interactive graphic, and a GUI.</li>
<li>pull data together to solve a contemporary problem.</li>
    </ul>
